## The Opportunity

365 Digital wants a channel partnership for AI implementation. They bring enterprise clients ($100M+ revenue companies) in life sciences, pharma, biotech, and manufacturing. They sell AI capabilities to their clients, you deliver the solutions. This is the same model they use for their cybersecurity partnership.

**Value:** $95-630K Year 1 (conservative to moderate)
**Model:** Channel partnership -- they sell, you deliver, revenue shared (structure TBD after first pilot)

## Key Context

**Their company:**
- Founded ~7 years ago (May 2019) by Bill (ex-Accenture) and Elaine
- Services: Enterprise ERP Project Management (Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O), project rescues, organizational change management
- Clients: Life sciences, pharma, biotech, medical devices
- Long engagements: 1-2 year typical
- Faith-based founders (former pastors/church planters)

**What they need from you:**
- AI automation architect
- Strategic thinker who understands operations (not just a coder)
- Can interview stakeholders and translate to technical requirements
- Partner who can grow with them

**Why you fit:**
- Business operations mastery (8 years music school)
- Enterprise-grade delivery (GFCU 100% accuracy)
- High communication skills
- Wonder + Discernment combo for spotting AI opportunities
- Track record of mastering complex domains

**Example use case Bill described:**
- BMW truck demand forecasting
- Current: manual planning, often wrong, wasted costs
- AI solution: historical data analysis, predict actual output, optimize scheduling

**Technology context:**
- Applications on top of Microsoft Dynamics F&O
- Azure ML, Python (Prophet, scikit-learn)
- Applied ML, not novel AI -- predictive analytics, forecasting, workflow automation

**Discovery engagement structure (Bill's words):**
"Your design period is probably an 8-16 week engagement just for design. Getting in there, interviewing the business, finding out how they run their process."
- Translation: you get PAID ($20-40K) for 8-16 weeks to learn their systems
