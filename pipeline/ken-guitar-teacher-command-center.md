# Ken / Guitar Teacher Command Center

**Client:** Ken (music school owner)
**Type:** Custom software build -- ACTIVE DELIVERY (overdue)
**Relationship:** Long-time client, high trust. Largest MRR client at $1,500/mo (ads/AI/website).

## The Project

Custom all-in-one platform for Ken's music school. Two major components:

**Core System ($8,000):**
- Student management
- Teacher support tools
- Parent communication
- Progress monitoring

**Practice App ($15,000):**
- Student practice tracking
- Practice logging and streaks
- Teacher-assigned exercises
- Parent visibility into practice habits

**Total Investment:** $23,000
**Tech Stack:** React, GoHighLevel integration, n8n workflows

---

## Current Status

**STATUS: OVERDUE**

Build has been paused repeatedly as Dereck needed to shift focus to income-generating activities (Retarget IQ, Ben/EquityPro, RAMP, etc.). Ken has been patient and trusting. This is a professional obligation that needs to be honored.

**What's remaining:** TBD -- need to assess where the build left off and determine remaining scope.

**Priority level:** Above all personal projects (Prayer Board, Vegan Spots, Elimination Diet, Good Bananas). This is a paid client deliverable, not a side project.

---

## Why This Matters

1. **Client trust:** Ken has invested $23K and waited. Delivering well protects the relationship.
2. **MRR protection:** Ken is $1,500/mo -- 72% of current MRR. Losing this relationship would be catastrophic.
3. **Professional reputation:** Finishing what you start is how you build a consultancy.
4. **Future opportunity:** Successful delivery opens SaaS productization ($200-300/mo per music school, see backlog.md).
5. **Case study:** 8 years owning a music school + 18-month retention vs industry 3-6 months = powerful marketing story.

## Key Context

- Ken also pays $1,500/mo for ongoing ads/AI/website management (separate from this build)
- The $23K project represents significant trust -- Ken chose Dereck over off-the-shelf solutions
- SaaS productization for other music schools is a future opportunity AFTER Ken's build is complete and stable
- Dereck's 8 years owning a music school gives him unmatched domain expertise for this build

---

## Timeline

- **Original start:** TBD (need to confirm with Dereck)
- **Paused multiple times:** To prioritize income generation (Retarget IQ, RAMP, Ben, etc.)
- **Feb 11:** Flagged as overdue. Added to dashboard as top-tier priority.
- **Next:** Assess remaining scope, set firm completion target, resume build.
