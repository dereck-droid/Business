# RAMP Manufacturing

**Company:** RAMP Manufacturing (www.rampmfg.com)
**Contacts:** Saj Patel, Dave Briggs, Joe Kreidler (co-founders)
**Referral Partner:** Joe Brennan
**Introduced via:** Joe Brennan (15+ years product dev/manufacturing)

---

## The Opportunity

RAMP needs AI to automate work instruction creation for manufacturing launches. Engineers currently spend 2-6 weeks per product creating 50-200 page work instructions. Goal: reduce that by 50-70% (down to 3-7 days) using an AI-powered knowledge base that learns over time.

**Phase 0 Discovery:** $6,500-7,500 (2-3 weeks)
**Phase 1 Implementation:** $25-35K (quoted after discovery)
**Long-term potential:** Manufacturing vertical entry, introductions to other manufacturers

---

## Key Context

**Their situation:**
- Absolute startup (self-funded, not at capacity yet)
- Seeking competitive advantage strategically
- 20+ years experience, well-networked with manufacturers
- Budget-conscious but understand value ($75K typical contracts, 20% margins)

**Proposal requirements (from Feb 2 meeting):**
- Phase 0 discovery scope and deliverables
- Architecture approach (database, hosting, AI models)
- Security approach (enterprise contracts, encryption, IP ownership)
- Licensing requirements
- Deployment model (cloud, local, hybrid)
- What's off-the-shelf vs. custom
- Team composition and roles

**Partnership with Joe Brennan:**
- Joe gets 30% of discovery ($2,100 for 12-15 hrs active work)
- Joe gets 15% of implementation (lower involvement)
- Positioned as team: Joe = manufacturing/industry, Dereck = AI/tech
