# RAMP Manufacturing

**Company:** RAMP Manufacturing (www.rampmfg.com)
**Contacts:** Saj Patel, Dave Briggs, Joe Kreidler (co-founders)
**Referral Partner:** Joe Brennan
**Introduced via:** Joe Brennan (15+ years product dev/manufacturing)

---

## The Opportunity

RAMP needs AI to automate work instruction creation for manufacturing launches. Engineers currently spend 2-6 weeks per product creating 50-200 page work instructions. Goal: reduce that by 50-70% (down to 3-7 days) using an AI-powered knowledge base that learns over time.

**Phase 0 Discovery:** $10,000 (3 weeks, 50/50 payment split)
**Phase 1 Implementation:** $25-45K (quoted after discovery)
**Long-term potential:** Manufacturing vertical entry, introductions to other manufacturers

---

## Key Context

**Their situation:**
- Absolute startup (self-funded, not at capacity yet)
- Seeking competitive advantage strategically
- 20+ years experience, well-networked with manufacturers
- Budget-conscious but understand value ($75K typical contracts, 20% margins)

**Proposal requirements (from Feb 2 meeting):**
- Phase 0 discovery scope and deliverables
- Architecture approach (database, hosting, AI models)
- Security approach (enterprise contracts, encryption, IP ownership)
- Licensing requirements
- Deployment model (cloud, local, hybrid)
- What's off-the-shelf vs. custom
- Team composition and roles

**Partnership with Joe Brennan:**
- Joe gets 20% of discovery ($2,000 for Phase 0 at $10K)
- Joe gets 10% of implementation
- Positioned as team: Joe = manufacturing/industry, Dereck = AI/tech

- **Jan 30:** Direct call with Saj & Dave -- problem defined, meeting scheduled
- **Feb 2:** 37-minute scoping meeting (Saj, Dave, Joe K, Joe B). Problem crystal clear. "Standing ovation" per Joe B.
- **Feb 6:** Original proposal due date
- **Feb 10:** Proposal finalized ($7K Phase 0 discovery). Studying prep docs for meeting.
- **Feb 11:** Proposal presented (24-min Zoom). $10K Phase 0. Positive reception, no pushback. Saj asked about POC scope, AI model selection, monthly costs. No signature -- RAMP busy with major gov event next week. Follow up week of Feb 23.

## Key Intel

- **RAMP is government-focused** -- preparing for face-to-face meetings with government clients. They're in launch phase. This explains budget consciousness but also validates long-term potential.
- **Saj is the decision-maker** -- asked all the questions, set the follow-up timeline.
- **Dave is quiet but bought in** -- no objections, no questions.
- **Dereck offered "Phase 0.5"** -- if they want deeper validation of logic transfer before full Phase 1 commitment. Could be a bridge if they hesitate on Phase 1 pricing.
