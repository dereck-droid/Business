# Lead Supercharger Partnership

**Company:** Retarget IQ (Alex Ciereszko & Nate Calhoun)
**Type:** Equity partnership (separate from the $4,500 automation project)

---

## The Opportunity

Low-ticket SaaS ($99-149/month) that enriches form leads with 40+ data points. Home service companies (plumbers, HVAC, roofers) get name/phone/email from forms but want 40+ additional data points for better qualification.

**Your role:** Tech development and maintenance
**Their role:** Customer acquisition, advertising, all upfront capital, data API at $0 cost
**Equity:** 20-25% to you, 75-80% to them

**Revenue potential:**
- Start: $5K/month easily achievable
- Scale: $30-40K/month realistic
- Your 20-25% at $30K = $6,000-7,500/month recurring

---

## Key Context

**V1 scope:** GoHighLevel marketplace app (2-3 weeks build)
**Days to cash:** 60-90 days (build + scale + first payments)

**Why this is strategic:**
- They already run at $30K/month with data business
- They handle distribution (10-15 appointments per day)
- Recurring revenue solves your MRR problem
- Partnership model plays to your strengths (build), delegates your weaknesses (sell)

**Key terms being negotiated:**
- Equity percentage -- targeting 30% (complexity analysis doc supports this)
- Ongoing maintenance expectations
- IP ownership
- Exit terms

## Timeline

- **Jan 20:** Partnership offered during Retarget IQ engagement
- **Jan 21-24:** Technical complexity research completed
- **Feb 7:** Nate texted confirming they still want to do LS. Asked about time/money to build. Discussed setting up a call. Dereck mentioned Thomas (wholesaler) as potential LS customer.
- **Feb 11:** Nate scheduled meeting for Fri Feb 13 2pm-3pm EST (Google Meet: meet.google.com/gce-cxjp-shp). Attendees: Dereck, Nate, Alex.
- **Feb 13:** Meeting -- discuss equity terms, V1 scope, next steps

---

## Strategic Note: Development Compensation

**Context:** When Nate texted Feb 7, he asked "How long do you think LS would take **money and time wise** to get built out." The "money" part is significant -- if this were purely equity-for-sweat, the question would've just been "how long."

**Possible reads:**
1. They want to pay a development stipend to fast-track the build (most interesting)
2. They're asking about infrastructure costs (boring read)
3. Due diligence on total investment cost

**Recommendation for Friday meeting:** Raise this naturally. Frame as: "To fast-track this and give it my full attention for 3-5 weeks, I'd need some support during the build. What does that look like for you guys?" Let them make the first offer. A dev stipend ($5-8K flat or $2-3K/mo during build) doesn't have to replace the 30% equity -- it can be in addition to it.

**Opportunity cost context:** 3-5 weeks of full-time build = $10-15K in lost billable work.
