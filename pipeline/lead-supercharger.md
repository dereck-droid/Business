# Lead Supercharger Partnership

**Company:** Retarget IQ (Alex Ciereszko & Nate Calhoun)
**Type:** Equity partnership (separate from the $4,500 automation project)

---

## The Opportunity

Low-ticket SaaS ($99-149/month) that enriches form leads with 40+ data points. Home service companies (plumbers, HVAC, roofers) get name/phone/email from forms but want 40+ additional data points for better qualification.

**Your role:** Tech development and maintenance
**Their role:** Customer acquisition, advertising, all upfront capital, data API at $0 cost
**Equity:** 20-25% to you, 75-80% to them

**Revenue potential:**
- Start: $5K/month easily achievable
- Scale: $30-40K/month realistic
- Your 20-25% at $30K = $6,000-7,500/month recurring

---

## Key Context

**V1 scope:** GoHighLevel marketplace app (2-3 weeks build)
**Days to cash:** 60-90 days (build + scale + first payments)

**Why this is strategic:**
- They already run at $30K/month with data business
- They handle distribution (10-15 appointments per day)
- Recurring revenue solves your MRR problem
- Partnership model plays to your strengths (build), delegates your weaknesses (sell)

**Key terms being negotiated:**
- Equity percentage (20-30% depending on technical complexity)
- Ongoing maintenance expectations
- IP ownership
- Exit terms
