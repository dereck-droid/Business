## Commission Structures by Service Type

### 1. Database Reactivation Services

**Structure:** 30% of profits (standard referral model)

**When This Applies:**
- AI-powered database reactivation campaigns
- Lead nurturing automation for dormant contacts
- SMS/email reactivation sequences
- Original service Joe partnered on

**Example:**
- Project revenue: $5,000 setup + $1/lead
- Joe's share: 30% of net profit
- Applied to: Fraser Roofing, pool builders, etc.

**Joe's Role:**
- Introduction/referral
- May assist with sales call
- Minimal ongoing involvement

---

### 2. Manufacturing Custom Build Projects

**Structure:** 20% discovery / 10% implementation / 10% ongoing

**When This Applies:**
- Work instruction automation (RAMP)
- Manufacturing workflow automation
- Custom software for manufacturers
- Any manufacturing vertical project

**Discovery Phase:**
- **Joe gets: 20%**
- Typical work: 10-12 hours
- Activities: Proposal formatting, terminology translation, client meetings
- Example: $7K discovery = $1,400 for Joe

**Implementation Phase:**
- **Joe gets: 10%**
- Typical work: 8-10 hours
- Activities: Client check-ins, relationship management, terminology support
- Example: $30K implementation = $3,000 for Joe

**Ongoing Projects:**
- **Joe gets: 10%**
- Each subsequent project with same client
- Example: RAMP builds 3 more products = $9,000 for Joe

**Why This Structure:**
- Joe is active team member (not just referral)
- Manufacturing credibility justifies team pricing
- Lower implementation % reflects reduced involvement
- Ongoing % incentivizes relationship nurturing

**Total RAMP Example (Discovery + Phase 1 + 3 more projects):**
- Discovery: $1,400
- Phase 1: $3,000
- 3 more products: $9,000
- **Total: $13,400** for ~30-35 hours = $383-447/hour

---

### 3. Secondary Referrals (Network Introductions)

**Structure:** Depends on Joe's involvement

**If Joe Actively Brings the Referral:**
- Manufacturing project: 20% discovery / 10% implementation
- Database reactivation: 30% of profits
- Joe must make the introduction and bring opportunity

**If Referral Comes Without Joe's Involvement:**
- **0%** - Even if from RAMP network or manufacturing space
- Example: RAMP refers you directly without Joe's involvement = no commission

**Why This Distinction:**
- Rewards active networking (not passive benefit)
- Incentivizes Joe to nurture relationships and make introductions
- Fair - commission follows work and value creation

**Example Scenarios:**

✅ **Joe Gets Commission:**
- Joe connects you to RAMP contact's friend who needs automation
- Joe facilitates warm intro to another manufacturer
- Joe brings opportunity from his network

❌ **Joe Gets No Commission:**
- RAMP directly refers you without involving Joe
- You meet manufacturer at conference Joe didn't arrange
- Client finds you organically even if in manufacturing

## Annual Earnings Potential Examples

### Conservative Year 1 (RAMP + 2 New Clients):

**RAMP:**

- Implementation: $3,000
- 2 more products: $6,000
- Subtotal: $10,400

**Client A (Manufacturing):**
- Discovery: $1,400
- Implementation: $3,000
- Subtotal: $4,400

**Client B (Database Reactivation):**
- Setup: $5K at 30% profit = $1,500

**Year 1 Total: $16,300** for ~35-40 hours = $407-465/hour

---

### Moderate Year 1 (RAMP + 4 New Clients):

**RAMP:**
- Discovery + Implementation + 3 more products: $13,400

**3 Manufacturing Clients:**
- 3 × $4,400 = $13,200

**2 Database Reactivation:**
- 2 × $1,500 = $3,000

**Year 1 Total: $29,600** for ~60-70 hours = $423-493/hour

---

### Optimistic Year 1 (RAMP Scales + Strong Referrals):

**RAMP:**
- Discovery + Implementation + 6 products: $19,400

**5 Manufacturing Clients:**
- 5 × $4,400 = $22,000

**3 Database Reactivation:**
- 3 × $1,500 = $4,500

**Year 1 Total: $45,900** for ~85-100 hours = $459-540/hour

---

## Key Distinctions from Standard Referral Partnerships

**Standard Referral Fee:** 10-15% one-time, transactional

**Joe's Partnership:**
- Manufacturing: 20%/10% + ongoing
- Database Reactivation: 30% profit share
- Active team member, not just finder
- Long-term relationship building
- Network leverage opportunity

**Why Dereck Can Afford This:**
1. Joe brings deals that wouldn't exist otherwise (new revenue)
2. His involvement justifies higher pricing (team vs. solo)
3. Manufacturing deals are high-value ($30-50K+)
4. Dereck's rates remain sustainable even with commission
5. Scales beautifully (both earn more as vertical grows)

---

## Agreement Terms

**Formalization:** Verbal agreement, documented here
**Duration:** Ongoing, can be adjusted with conversation
**Review Cadence:** After every 2-3 deals or quarterly
**Amendment Process:** Open discussion, mutual agreement

**Current Status:** Active and productive partnership

---

## Historical Context

**Partnership Evolution:**
1. **Original Agreement (8 months ago):** 30% for database reactivation referrals
2. **Business Pivot (5 months ago):** Dereck shifted from database reactivation to custom software
3. **Manufacturing Entry (Feb 2026):** New structure created for manufacturing vertical
4. **Finalized (Feb 5, 2026):** Joe graciously trusted Dereck to determine fair structure

**Why Structure Changed:**
- Database reactivation: Mostly automated, scales easily → 30% sustainable
- Custom software: 40-150 hours labor-intensive → 30% unsustainable
- Manufacturing: Joe is active team member → 20%/10% reflects contribution
- Future: May adjust as we learn what works

## Success Metrics

## Notes & Observations

**What Works Well:**
- Joe's gracious, trusting approach to compensation discussion
- Clear distinction between service types (manufacturing vs. database reactivation)
- Commission tied to actual work and contribution
- Secondary referral structure incentivizes active networking
- Both parties earning excellent effective hourly rates

**What to Monitor:**
- Does 20%/10% feel fair to Joe after first few deals?
- Is Joe actually bringing secondary referrals from RAMP network?
- Are we both satisfied with workload vs. compensation balance?
- Should we formalize in written agreement at some point?

**Future Considerations:**
- If manufacturing vertical scales to 10+ clients, consider retainer model
- If Joe's involvement increases, revisit percentages
- If new service lines emerge, create appropriate structures
- Potentially formalize partnership agreement after 12 months
