## This Week's Priorities

1. **Email RAMP proposal** -- Send final proposal deck to Saj and Joe. No follow-up until week of Feb 23 (gov event next week).
2. **Ben/EquityPro** -- Waiting on Ben's reply to liens counter-proposal ($300 + $250/mo for 10x leads) and CRM decision. Ball is in his court.
3. **365 Digital follow-up** -- AI use case PDF sent. If no reply by Friday, reach out and ask if he's had any client conversations.
