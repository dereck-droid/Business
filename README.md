# Advanced Lead Solutions -- Business Context Repository

AI automation consultancy owned by Dereck Johnson, based in South Carolina. This repository is the single source of business context for daily AI-assisted strategy sessions.

## Quick Start

**Read `dashboard.md` first.** It has current finances, pipeline, and priorities.

For deeper context, read these in order:
1. `dashboard.md` -- where things stand right now
2. `company/identity.md` -- what the business is
3. `services/offerings.md` -- what we sell
4. `pipeline/` -- active deals and their history

## Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Entry point for Claude Code sessions (read automatically) |
| `dashboard.md` | **Single source of truth** -- finances, pipeline, priorities |
| `backlog.md` | Deferred product ideas and future initiatives |
| `company/` | Business identity, personality profile, owner background |
| `services/` | Service offerings, pricing, delivery approach |
| `pipeline/` | One file per active opportunity with full context |
| `projects/` | Product/app documentation (Prayer Board, Elimination Diet, etc.) |
| `communications/` | Meeting transcripts, quotes, follow-ups |
| `archive/` | Historical files -- don't read unless specifically needed |

## Design Principles

1. **One source of truth.** Status data lives in `dashboard.md` only. No duplication.
2. **Evergreen over temporal.** Root-level files are always-relevant. Dated content goes in `archive/`.
3. **Lean.** Every file should justify its existence. When in doubt, don't create a new file.
4. **Context, not status.** Pipeline files provide history and analysis. Dashboard provides current state.
