# 📁 Business Context Repository

**Advanced Lead Solutions - Strategic Business Database**

**Last Updated:** January 20, 2026

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as the comprehensive business context database for Advanced Lead Solutions. It enables Claude Code (and future AI agents/team members) to quickly understand the business, active deals, financial status, and strategic priorities without needing to ask clarifying questions in every session.

---

## Quick Start - Read These First

### 🎯 **START HERE:** [FOCUS.md](./FOCUS.md)
**Your daily decision dashboard** - Updated daily/every other day
- Current financial status and runway
- Top priority opportunities ranked by score
- Today's actions and this week's milestones
- Strategic context based on current zone (Red/Yellow/Green)

**Use this file EVERY MORNING to know what to work on.**

---

### 📊 **Financial & Pipeline Status**
- [Financial Snapshot](./metrics/financial-snapshot.md) - Cash position, bills, runway calculation
- [Revenue Tracking](./metrics/revenue-tracking.md) - MRR, pipeline value, revenue goals
- [Prospect Tracker](./opportunities/prospect-tracker.md) - All active prospects with priority scores
- [Pipeline Value](./opportunities/pipeline-value.md) - Total opportunity value and projections

---

### 🏢 **Who We Are**
- [Business Identity](./company/identity.md) - Mission, market, current stage
- [Personality Profile](./company/personality-profile.md) - ENFP + Working Genius (critical for understanding decision-making)
- [Owner Background](./company/background.md) - 8 years music school, agency, non-profit experience

---

### 🛠️ **What We Offer**
- [Service Offerings](./services/offerings.md) - Database reactivation, custom software, AI assistants, automations
- [Pricing Models](./services/pricing.md) - How we charge, package deals, partnership structures
- [Delivery Approach](./services/delivery.md) - Tech stack, BMAD methodology, collaboration model

---

### 📋 **Dynamic Task Backlog**
- [Backlog](./backlog.md) - All tasks with urgency, importance, zone viability, and changing conditions
  - Learning & skills (Claude Code mastery when conditions warrant)
  - Product completions (Prayer Board, Ad Checker, Elimination Diet)
  - Strategic initiatives (referral network, partnerships, hiring)
  - Infrastructure (Focus Agent, integrations)
  - Personal development (financial skills, work-life balance)

**How it works:**
- Each task has urgency (1-10), importance (1-10), zone viability (Red/Yellow/Green)
- **Conditions change priorities** - church calls about Prayer Board? Urgency jumps from 4/10 to 10/10
- Adapts to your reality - not rigid rules, but dynamic decision-making
- Wonder is satisfied (ideas captured), Tenacity isn't overwhelmed (clear focus)
