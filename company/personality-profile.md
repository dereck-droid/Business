- Financial admin: Behind on vehicle payments

**Solution Required:**
- ✅ Systems and automation for execution
- ✅ AI tools (Claude Code, Focus Agent)
- ✅ External accountability structures
- ✅ Future team members who LOVE Tenacity work
- ✅ Partnership models (Retarget IQ handles delivery)

#### The Focus Problem

**ENFP Idea Generation + Wonder Genius:**

**Manifests As:**
- Too many exciting possibilities
- Difficulty choosing what to pursue
- Shiny object syndrome
- Unclear priorities

**Current Example:**
Multiple competing priorities:
- Music school software (in progress)
- Prayer Board (85% done)
- Ad Checker (partial complete)
- Elimination Diet (amazing idea, not started)
- Lead Supercharger (new partnership offer)
- Ben/EquityPro (meeting next week)
- Kin upgrade (decision pending)
- Pool campaign (ongoing)
- L2T Media (meeting scheduled)
- 365 Digital (meeting scheduled)

**This is TOO MUCH for one person.**

**Solution Required:**
- ✅ Ruthless prioritization framework (built in this repository)
- ✅ External accountability (Focus Agent daily check-in)
- ✅ Clear decision criteria (priority scoring system)
- ✅ Financial zones (Red/Yellow/Green) dictate focus
- ✅ ONE primary priority at a time

## Optimal Business Model for Your Personality

### What Works ✅

**Custom Solutions Over Productized Services:**
- Your creativity and relationship skills shine
- Each project is unique and interesting
- Prevents boredom and maintains engagement

**High-Touch, Low-Volume:**
- Deep client relationships vs. transactional scale
- Quality over quantity aligns with values
- Play to relationship-building strength

**Project-Based Consulting:**
- Engagement variety prevents boredom
- Leverage Wonder + Discernment strengths
- Each discovery phase is energizing

**Values-Aligned Work:**
- "Good Works Automation" keeps you motivated
- Personal meaning = sustained energy
- Example: Prayer Board most energizing despite less immediate revenue

---

### What Doesn't Work ❌

**High-Volume Transactional:**
- Requires process consistency you find draining
- No relationships = no motivation
- Burns you out quickly

**Routine Maintenance Work:**
- Boredom leads to disengagement
- Not playing to strengths
- Should be handed off to systems/team

**Detail-Intensive Compliance:**
- Drains your energy
- Takes you out of Genius
- Example: GFCU project was technically successful but exhausting?

**Slow, Methodical Execution:**
- Your brain wants to move faster
- Perceiving preference = want to keep options open
- Need faster feedback loops

---

## Decision-Making Framework Based on Personality

### When to Say YES ✅

**Alignment Checks:**
1. ✅ Aligns with "less stress, more success" mission
2. ✅ Excites your Wonder (you see creative possibilities)
3. ✅ Your Discernment says "this feels right"
4. ✅ Client relationship feels genuine and values-aligned
5. ✅ Project has clear revenue impact
6. ✅ Can be executed with AI/systems (low Tenacity demand)
7. ✅ Fits current financial zone priorities

**Current Examples:**
- ✅ Lead Supercharger: Checks ALL boxes + recurring revenue
- ✅ Ben/EquityPro: Warm lead, clear opportunity, relationship-based
- ✅ Kin upgrade: Existing relationship, quick close, immediate revenue

---

### When to Say NO ❌

**Red Flags:**
1. ❌ Requires heavy ongoing maintenance (Tenacity demand)
2. ❌ Feels purely transactional (no relationship/meaning)
3. ❌ Your Discernment has doubts (trust your gut!)
4. ❌ Requires you to be someone you're not
5. ❌ No clear path to completion/revenue
6. ❌ Takes you away from higher-value opportunities
7. ❌ Wrong timing for financial zone

**Current Examples:**
- ❌ Starting Elimination Diet app NOW (wrong zone - need cash first)
- ❌ Civil engineering firms (Discernment said no, data confirmed)
- ❌ Building new solutions when should be closing deals (zone mismatch)

## Managing Your Personality in Business

### Daily Structure

**Morning (Peak Energy - Genius Time):**
- Creative work and strategy
- Client discovery conversations
- Solution design and planning
- Wonder + Discernment activities

**Afternoon (Lower Energy - Competency/Support):**
- Implementation support via Claude Code
- Scheduled follow-up calls
- Client communication
- Galvanizing + Enablement activities

**Avoid (Whenever Possible):**
- Long stretches of administrative work
- Detail-heavy tasks without breaks

---

### Weekly Discipline

**Monday Morning:**
- Priority setting: What ONE thing must get done this week?
- Review FOCUS.md
- Check financial zone status
- Set clear success metric for the week

**Wednesday Check-In:**
- Am I staying focused or chasing shiny objects?
- Is my ONE priority actually progressing?
- Do I need to course-correct?

**Friday Completion Review:**
- What can I finish and take off my plate?
- What's actually DONE (not 90% done)?
- Celebrate completions (important for ENFP dopamine)
- Update FOCUS.md for next week

---

### Project Selection Criteria

**Before Starting Anything New, Ask:**

1. **Can it be completed with AI/automation tools?**
   - YES = Reduces Tenacity demand
   - NO = Will drain energy, proceed cautiously

2. **Does it energize my Wonder and Discernment?**
   - YES = Stay in Genius, sustainable
   - NO = Will burn out quickly

3. **Is there clear revenue within 30-60 days?**
   - In RED ZONE: Must be YES
   - In YELLOW: Should be YES
   - In GREEN: Can be longer-term

4. **Can I hand off execution to systems/tools/partners?**
   - YES = Sustainable, scalable
   - NO = Limited by your Tenacity capacity

5. **Does my Discernment say YES?**
   - Trust your gut
   - If it feels off, it probably is
   - You're rarely wrong when you listen
