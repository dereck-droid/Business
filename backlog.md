## How This Works

This is a **unified, dynamic task system** that adapts to your current financial zone and changing conditions.

### Task Attributes

Each task has:
- **Urgency** (1-10): How time-sensitive is this?
- **Importance** (1-10): Strategic value and impact
- **Zone Viability**: Red / Yellow / Green minimum required
- **Time Investment**: Hours or weeks needed
- **Revenue Impact**: Immediate / Short-term / Long-term / Indirect
- **Status**: Deferred / Active / Completed
- **Conditions That Change Priority**: When does this become urgent?

### How FOCUS.md Uses This

Your daily dashboard ([FOCUS.md](./FOCUS.md)) filters these tasks based on:
1. **Your Current Zone** (Red/Yellow/Green)
2. **Urgency + Importance scores**
3. **Zone Viability** (can you work on this now?)
4. **Changing Conditions** (what would make this urgent?)

**Result:** You see what's actionable NOW and what's waiting for the right conditions.

### Build Good Bananas App

**Current Assessment:**
- **Urgency:** 2/10 (idea stage, longer validation needed)
- **Importance:** 8/10 (unique concept, genuine market gap)
- **Zone Viability:** 🟢 Green minimum (requires 1-2 weeks for MVP)
- **Time Investment:** 1-2 weeks MVP, 2-3 months to validate
- **Revenue Impact:** Long-term ($45K Y1 → $1.23M Y3 potential)
- **Status:** DEFERRED (extensive concept documentation complete, not started)
- **Dependencies:** Green Zone OR after Vegan Spots validates app-building model

**Documentation:** [Good Bananas - Full Concept](./detailed-context/projects/good-bananas-app.md)

**Core Concept:**
Crowdsource real-time geo-located information about where to find ripe bananas at grocery stores. Users check in when they spot ripe bananas, creating live map for the community.

**The Problem:**
- Americans consume 20 billion bananas annually (75% buy regularly)
- 30% of shoppers cite fresh produce as frequently poor quality
- 54% visit 3+ stores to find what they need
- User personal experience: often visits multiple stores for ripe bananas
- Banana ripeness worse in winter months

**CRITICAL Design Philosophy - Keep It Pure:**
- NO financial rewards or incentives for reporting
- NO ability to report "bad" bananas (only good ones)
- NO paywalled data that hides community contributions
- Tribal/community motivation ONLY (like Wikipedia, Waze)
- Humor and absurdity IS the engagement mechanism
- Identity: "I help fellow banana seekers"

**Revenue Model (Preserves Purity):**
1. **B2B Data Licensing** (primary) - sell anonymized trend data to grocery chains, produce distributors
2. **Optional Store Tools** ($50-99/month) - analytics, promotions (user experience identical whether store pays)
3. **Premium User Subscription** ($2.99-4.99/month) - ad-free, push notifications (optional, later)
4. **Minimal Advertising** - produce-related brands only
5. **Exit Strategy** - sell to Instacart, Kroger, Whole Foods ($500K-2M potential)

**Technical Build:**
- Fast MVP options: PWA (3-5 days) or no-code (1-2 days with Airtable + Softr + n8n)
- Full build: React Native + Supabase + Google Maps + n8n (1-2 weeks)
- Geofencing verification (must be at store)
- Photo with timestamp requirement
- Rate limiting (1 check-in per store per day per user)
- Map view showing recent reports

**Launch Strategy:**
- Month 1: Greenville/Simpsonville only, 100 active users
- Month 2-3: Expand to nearby cities (Spartanburg, Anderson), 500-1000 users
- Month 3-6: Approach grocery chains with data insights (1,000+ users = leverage)
- Month 6+: Scale to other cities OR explore acquisition

**Unique Advantages:**
- No direct competition (truly unique positioning)
- Strong emotional hook (shared frustration)
- Inherently shareable (absurdist humor, viral-friendly)
- Fast to build (1-2 weeks)
- Multiple revenue paths
- Could expand to all produce types
- Exit potential to grocery tech companies

**Why Second Priority (After Vegan Spots):**
- Hypothetical users vs. solving your own pain
- Easier to copy vs. AI agent moat
- Lower engagement frequency (occasional vs. regular dining)
- Critical mass dependency (needs many users per area)
- Seasonal fluctuation (banana quality varies)

**Comparable Apps:**
- **Waze** (best comparison): Crowdsourced traffic, tribal motivation, sold to Google for $1.1B
- **GasBuddy**: 70M downloads, B2B revenue from gas stations, data licensing
- Keep user contribution pure, monetize through B2B

**Conditions That Change Priority:**
- ✅ **Vegan Spots successful** → Urgency becomes 6/10 (validated app-building model)
- ✅ **Growth partner wants portfolio of apps** → Urgency becomes 7/10
- ✅ **Quick MVP test shows strong engagement** → Urgency becomes 8/10
- ✅ **Grocery chain expresses interest** → Urgency becomes 9/10
- ✅ **Green Zone + time between projects** → Urgency becomes 5/10

**Current Decision:** DEFER until Green Zone AND after Vegan Spots - **BUILD SECOND as portfolio piece**

- **Revenue Impact:** None (this IS the point of everything else)
- **Status:** DEFERRED but critical (address incrementally as stabilize)
- **Dependencies:** Yellow/Green Zone to reduce financial stress

**Current State:**
- Financial stress impacting family
- Two young daughters
- Marriage challenges
- Relocated to new location (South Carolina)
- Probably working too much, stressed too much

**Goals When Stable:**
- Establish work boundaries (evenings/weekends with family)
- Date nights and marriage investment
- Quality time with daughters (present, not stressed)
- Sabbath/rest practice (faith-based rest)
- Exercise and health routines
- Social connections in new community

**Why It Matters:**
- Family is priority (not just business)
- Burnout prevention
- ENFP needs variety and social connection
- Faith integration (values-driven life)
- Business exists to serve life, not vice versa

**Conditions That Change Priority:**
- ✅ **Marriage crisis intensifies** → Urgency becomes 10/10 (address immediately)
- ✅ **Yellow Zone reached** → Urgency becomes 8/10 (start implementing boundaries)
- ✅ **Green Zone reached** → Urgency becomes 7/10 (fully implement)
- ✅ **Health crisis from burnout** → Urgency becomes 10/10

**Current Decision:** Implement incrementally as stability grows, but don't lose sight of this

### Weekly Review

**Every Monday or Friday:**
1. Review active tasks
2. Check if any conditions have changed
3. Update urgency/importance if needed
4. Move completed tasks to Completed section
5. Add any new ideas that emerged

---

### When Conditions Change

**Examples of Condition Changes:**
- Church calls about Prayer Board → Prayer Board urgency 4/10 → 10/10
- Land $50K contract needing Claude skills → Learning urgency 3/10 → 9/10
- MRR hits $8K → Hiring VA urgency 4/10 → 7/10
- Pool campaign fails → Channel testing urgency 4/10 → 7/10
- Yellow Zone reached → Multiple tasks become viable

**What to Do:**
1. Update task urgency in this file
2. Add to FOCUS.md priorities if now urgent
3. Adjust other priorities accordingly
4. Document why conditions changed (context for future)

---

### Preventing Shiny Object Syndrome

**When Tempted to Start Everything:**
1. Read FOCUS.md first (what's your zone? what's urgent NOW?)
2. Check task's Zone Viability (can you even work on this now?)
3. Review Conditions (what would make this urgent? Has that happened?)
4. Trust the system (the idea won't disappear, it's captured)
5. Return to current priority

**Remember:**
- Wonder will ALWAYS generate more ideas (genius!)
- Discernment can evaluate them later (wisdom!)
- Tenacity can only execute ONE thing well (reality!)
- Focus on completion = revenue = stability = can do more
