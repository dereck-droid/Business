# Ben/EquityPro Follow-Up Call Script

**Date:** January 30, 2026 (Thursday afternoon)
**Purpose:** Present SmartLead + GHL architecture and pricing
**Goal:** Get commitment to move forward

---

## 🎯 OPENING

"Hey Ben, thanks again for the time this morning. As I mentioned, I wanted to follow up after doing some deeper research on the technical approach for your 8,000-10,000 cold leads. Do you have 10-15 minutes?"

---

## 🏗️ THE ARCHITECTURE (Why Two Platforms)

### The Problem with GHL-Only for Cold Email

"After our call, I consulted with a GHL expert who's built over 300 systems. Here's what I learned:

**Your 8,000-10,000 leads are 24-36 months cold** - that's definitively cold outreach territory.

Using GoHighLevel alone for that scale of cold email has serious risks:
- Could blacklist your domain
- Affects your business email deliverability
- Lacks sophisticated cold email features
- GHL is designed for inbound/warm leads, not cold outreach

**The expert explicitly recommended against it.**"

### The Right Approach: SmartLead + GHL

"The right way is a **two-platform architecture**:

**SmartLead = Cold Email Engine (Behind the Scenes)**
- Handles all cold outreach to your 8K-10K leads
- Built-in email warmup (protects your domain)
- GPT-4 automatically categorizes responses: Interested, Objection, Referral, Out-of-Office
- Advanced cold email features (email variations, smart domain rotation)
- Runs in the background - protects your main domain

**GoHighLevel = Your Command Center (What Your Team Uses)**
- This is the interface your team sees and uses daily
- When SmartLead gets an "interested" response, it automatically sends that lead to GHL
- GHL handles the warm nurturing from there
- Your team primarily works in GHL - SmartLead runs invisibly

**From your team's perspective:** It feels like ONE unified system, but you get the benefits of best-in-class cold email protection.

**And here's what makes this implementation different:** I'm not just dropping in a generic template. I'm going to work closely with you and your team to understand how you currently operate in your existing CRM - what works, what doesn't, what your team is used to. Then I'll **mirror those proven workflows in the new system** so adoption is smooth. Your team won't feel like they're learning something completely foreign. Plus, we'll identify opportunities to streamline and improve efficiency where it makes sense."

## 🎯 ROI FRAMING

"Let me put this in perspective:

**Even in worst-case scenario (1% appointments, 10% close):**
- 8,000 leads × 1% = 80 appointments
- 80 × 10% = 8 deals
- 8 × $12K = $96K revenue
- **ROI: 4.9x even if things go poorly**

**Conservative scenario (2-3% appointments, 15% close):**
- 24-36 deals = $288K-$432K revenue
- **ROI: 14-22x**

**You've invested $150K-$300K in your current CRM** that can't do this. What I'm proposing costs **6-13% of that investment** but delivers exponentially more capability and protects your domain reputation."

## ❓ DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (If Needed)

**Quick clarifications:**

1. "For the cold email campaigns, you mentioned you have templates. Can I work from those and adapt them for cold email best practices?"

2. "For follow-up drips, would you write those yourselves or want my guidance on structure?"

3. "How many team members will be using the system daily?"

4. "Does your senior team need to approve this, or can you make the decision?"

## 🚀 CLOSING

### Direct Ask

"Based on what we discussed this morning and the two-platform architecture I'm recommending, does $19,500 with [payment option] make sense for EquityPro?"

**[SILENCE - let him respond]**

### If He Says YES

"Excellent. I'll send over the agreement this afternoon. Once you sign and we get the first payment, I'll kick off the setup immediately. We'll have you operational in 30 days."

### If He Needs to Think / Consult Team

"That's completely understandable. What specific information does your team need to make the decision?"

[Provide whatever they need]

"When would be good for a follow-up call after you've had a chance to discuss?"

[Pin down specific date/time - don't let it drift]

### If He Balks at Price

"I hear you on the investment. Let me ask: compared to the $150K-$300K you've already spent on your current system, and given the 14-22x ROI we discussed, what feels off about the $19,500?"

[Listen to his actual objection]

**Possible responses:**
- "We could phase it - start with $12K for basic setup, then add the advanced features once you see results"
- "I can add a 60-day timeline option for $16,500 if you don't need the 30-day rush"
- "Would ongoing monthly management at lower upfront make more sense? $16,500 setup + $1,750/month"
