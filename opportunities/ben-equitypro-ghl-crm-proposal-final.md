## Investment & Payment Options

**Total Investment: $19,500**

*(Normal scope and timeline pricing: $25,000. Priority pricing for you because I value our relationship and look forward to continuing to work together.)*

### Payment Options

**Option A: 4 Monthly Payments (Recommended)**
- $4,875/month for 4 months
- Even though work completes in 30 days
- Easiest on cash flow

**Option B: 50/50**
- $9,750 at start
- $9,750 at completion

**Option C: 3 Milestone Payments**
- $7,800 at start (40%)
- $5,850 at midpoint (30%)
- $5,850 at completion (30%)

## Monthly Platform Costs (Ongoing)

Paid directly to platforms:
- **SmartLead Pro:** $94/month (cold email engine with GPT-4 categorization)
- **GoHighLevel:** $297/month (unlimited contacts, all 15 users)
- **Total:** $391/month

Plus usage-based costs you're already paying (SMS/MMS, phone numbers).

---

## Why This Makes Sense

Your current Drupal CRM cost hundreds of thousands but gets you "about a third of the way there." This investment:

- Gets you to 100% functional for a fraction of that cost
- Eliminates ongoing custom development fees
- Provides immediate lead engagement
- Centralizes all communications
- Enables team performance tracking
- Future-proofs with endless API capabilities

Plus, this positions us for the secondary projects we discussed (live lead pull system, etc.).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Agreement:** Review and sign
2. **First Payment:** Process initial payment per chosen option
3. **Kickoff Call:** Schedule within 48 hours
4. **Access:** Provide current CRM, website, and Constant Contact access
5. **Launch:** Begin 30-day implementation
