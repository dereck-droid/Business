## What's Included

### Complete CRM Setup

**Seller Pipeline**
- Acquisition workflow configuration
- Marketing campaign tracking
- Lead source attribution
- Automated follow-up sequences
- Team assignment rules

**Buyer/Investor Pipeline**
- Investor profiles with buy box criteria
- Property filtering and matching
- Purchase history tracking
- Automated property distribution
- Engagement workflows

### Centralized Communications
All in one interface:
- Facebook/IG Messenger
- WhatsApp
- SMS
- Email

Plus:
- Missed call text back (automatic)
- Video-to-text capability
- Call and text directly through platform

### Email Marketing Migration
- Migrate off Constant Contact (limited API/webhook functionality)
- SmartLead for cold/outbound email campaigns
  - SmartLead remains the cold outbound email tool. All positive responses are shot over to GHL, and a team member is flagged to engage with them.
  - We can also update contacts in GHL based on interactions within SmartLead campaigns, such as "Not Interested" or "Unsubscribes."
- GHL for warm/inbound lead nurturing
- Domain and inbox setup for both platforms
- Email warmup and deliverability configuration

### Team Management (15 Users)
- Role-based permissions (granular control)
- Admin vs User access levels
- Private contact lists per team member if desired
- Performance tracking dashboards
- Lead routing automation

### Website Integration
- Lead capture forms
- Automatic CRM entry
- Immediate SMS/email engagement
- Appointment booking automation

### Training & Support
- Team member training (2-3 hours)
- Documentation and SOPs
- 30-day post-launch technical support

---

## What You Provide

- Business details
- Access to you/your team
- Current CRM data export (sellers and buyers)
- Team member information for account setup
- Website and Constant Contact access

---

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Kickoff, GHL setup, team accounts, begin email configuration
**Week 2:** Begin meetings (2-3) with you and your team to learn about your current workflow and to improve and automate it. Pipeline builds, SmartLead setup, data migration planning
**Week 3:** Continued meetings (1-2). Workflow configuration, website integration, begin testing
**Week 4:** Team training, final testing, go-live preparation

**Day 30:** System operational and ready for team presentation

---

## Investment & Payment Options

**Total Investment: $19,500**

*(Normal scope and timeline pricing: $25,000. Priority pricing for you because I value our relationship and look forward to continuing to work together.)*

### Payment Options

**Option A: 4 Monthly Payments (Recommended)**
- $4,875/month for 4 months
- Even though work completes in 30 days
- Easiest on cash flow

**Option B: 50/50**
- $9,750 at start
- $9,750 at completion

---

## Monthly Platform Costs (Ongoing)

Paid directly to platforms:
- **SmartLead Pro:** $94/month
- **GoHighLevel:** $297/month (unlimited contacts, all 15 users)
- **Total:** $391/month

Plus usage-based costs you're already paying (SMS/MMS, phone numbers).

---

## Why This Makes Sense

Your current Drupal CRM gets you "about a third of the way there" and is restricting you from adding the technologically advanced workflows that will set you apart and keep you ahead of your competition who are slow to evolve. This investment:

- Gets you to 100% functional for a fraction of that cost
- Eliminates ongoing custom development fees
- Provides immediate lead engagement
- Centralizes all communications
- Enables team performance tracking
- Future-proofs with endless API capabilities

Plus, this positions us for the secondary projects we discussed (live lead pull system, etc.).

## InvestorBase Integration - All Your Tools in ONE Place

You mentioned needing InvestorBase for buyer prospecting, and I have great news: **InvestorBase will live INSIDE your GoHighLevel CRM.**

### How It Works

**1. Embedded in Your Sidebar**
InvestorBase supports iframe embedding, which means I'll add it as a custom menu link directly in your GHL navigation. Your team clicks one button and InvestorBase opens right there - no leaving the CRM, no separate logins to remember.

**2. Zapier Integration**
When your team finds a buyer in InvestorBase (searching by area, buy box, investment type), they click "Send to Zapier" and that contact instantly appears in your buyer pipeline. No CSV exports, no manual data entry.

**The Experience:**
- Jason searches InvestorBase for fix & flip investors in College Park
- Finds 3 qualified buyers and highlights them
- Clicks "Send to Zapier"
- All 3 contacts appear in his buyer pipeline immediately
- He texts them about a new property - all from the same interface

**Your Concern About Tools Not Being Unified?** Solved. InvestorBase lives inside the CRM. Your team works in ONE place!

## You Own This Build - Complete Ownership & Portability

Let me address the ownership question directly: **You own 100% of this custom build. Not me - you.**

### What You Own

- ✅ All workflows and automations (every sequence, every trigger)
- ✅ All custom fields and pipelines (seller/buyer structures)
- ✅ All contacts and data (export anytime, unlimited)
- ✅ All integrations and configurations (SmartLead, website, forms)
- ✅ All team permissions and settings

### Transfer Process (If You Ever Want To)

Transferring your build to your own GoHighLevel subscription is as simple as the click of a few buttons and I've done it multiple times. Data, workflows, users and permissions - everything stays intact. We can include language in the agreement for this. So you know you're protected.

**No vendor lock-in. No data held hostage. Complete portability.**

### Why Stay on My Plan?

**Benefit #1: Cost Savings**
- My plan: $297/month (what you pay)
- Direct GHL: $497/month (what you'd pay for the level of functionality on my plan)
- Savings: $2,400/year for the same features

**Benefit #2: Ongoing Support**
- Priority troubleshooting (vs. GHL's generic support queue)
- New workflow requests as your business evolves. I'll have direct access and permissions to work on future projects
- Platform updates and new AI features (GHL ships constantly)
- I know your system inside and out

**Benefit #3: Future Projects**
- Live lead pull system we discussed
- Additional automation as you identify needs
- Expansion to other markets

**But the choice is always yours.** Stay because it makes financial sense and I provide value, not because you're stuck.

## What Your Team Will See Daily

I'm creating a video walkthrough showing exactly what your team members will see when they log in. Here's what to expect:

### Jason's Morning (Acquisition Rep)

**8:30 AM - Logs in to clean dashboard**
- 3 tasks for today: Follow up with Maria (hot lead), call David back, send offer to Linda
- New SMS from motivated seller: "Got your letter, interested in selling"

**8:45 AM - Checks conversations**
- All his SMS, email, and Facebook messages in one inbox
- Responds to seller directly from platform

**9:15 AM - Moves deals through pipeline**
- Drag Maria's card from "Contacted" to "Appointment Set"
- Calendar automatically sends her confirmation SMS
- Ben sees updated pipeline value in his admin dashboard

**10:00 AM - Property goes under contract**
- Moves deal to "Under Contract" stage
- Triggers automatic workflow: notify buyer list

### Sarah's Workflow (Disposition Rep)

**Clicks InvestorBase in sidebar**
- New property at 1847 Lake Shore Dr (Maria's house)
- Searches InvestorBase: "Fix & flip investors, College Park area"
- Finds 5 qualified buyers
- Clicks "Send to GHL" - all 5 appear in her buyer pipeline

**Sends property blast**
- Filters buyers by criteria (price range, property type, area)
- Sends personalized SMS blast to 12 qualified buyers, addressing each by name
- Responses come back to unified inbox
- First reply in 8 minutes: "I'll take it. When can I see it?"

### Ben's View (Owner/Admin)

**Performance Dashboard**
- Pipeline value: $1.2M in active deals
- This week: 7 appointments set, 2 under contract, 1 closed
- Team performance: Jason (4 deals), Sarah (3 deals), Marcus (2 deals)
- Response rates: 38% from AI outreach campaigns

**Lead Routing**
- New lead comes in from website at 7:42 PM
- System automatically assigns to next rep in rotation (Marcus)
- Marcus gets SMS: "New hot lead assigned - Maria Rodriguez, pre-foreclosure"
- Lead doesn't slip through cracks

**Permission Controls (if utilized)**
- Jason can only see his contacts (not Sarah's or Marcus's)
- Sarah can see all buyers (disposition role)
- Ben can see everything (admin role)
- Granular control over what each person accesses
