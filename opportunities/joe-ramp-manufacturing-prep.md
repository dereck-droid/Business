## Meeting Context

**Who is Joe:**
- Your referral partner (15+ years in product development/manufacturing launches)
- Connected you with Sajid Patel from Ramp Manufacturing
- Validated the problem space: "This depicts a product development and manufacturing launch process that I understand"

**What Joe Shared:**
- Sajid sent NDA (signed, confidential)
- Document describing RAMP's AI platform for manufacturing workflows
- Joe's message: Problem space is real based on his 15 years of experience
- Sajid is "seeking assistance with a project specific to AI in mfg. Workflows"

**The Mystery:**
Document is 90% vision, 10% reality. Need to understand:
- What actually exists vs. what's aspirational?
- What do they need YOU to build?
- Why bring in outside technical help?
- Is there budget/timeline?

---

## Your Strategic Position

**What You Bring:**
- ✅ AI automation and workflow integration expertise
- ✅ n8n mastery for complex workflow orchestration
- ✅ Proven enterprise-grade work (GFCU 100% accuracy)
- ✅ Claude Code as manufacturing domain knowledge accelerator

**What You DON'T Have:**
- ❌ Manufacturing industry experience
- ❌ Factory floor, production, supply chain background
- ❌ Experience with PLCs, SCADA, MES, ERP systems

**Your Positioning:**
"I'm not an expert on manufacturing, but I am the expert in automation. I'll need guidance on the manufacturing domain knowledge, and I'll apply AI automation expertise to solve the workflow problem."

**Additional Credibility:**
- Mention 365 Digital ERP plugin project (Friday meeting): "I'm in discussions with another client about an ERP plugin for manufacturing/shipping workflows, so I'm actively learning this space."

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR JOE

### 1. The Real Story
**"What's your relationship with Sajid? How did this come about?"**
- Purpose: Understand the referral dynamic

## Your Discovery Framework for Sajid Call

**IF Joe's intel suggests this is worth pursuing, here's your framework for the Sajid call:**

### Questions to Ask Sajid:

**1. Scope Definition:**
- "What specific workflow or process are you looking to enhance with AI?"
- "Is this primarily a data/software challenge or does it involve hardware/machinery?"
- "What systems/platforms would this need to integrate with?"

**2. Success Criteria:**
- "What does success look like? What metrics would improve?"
- "What's currently manual that should be automated?"
- "What's the business impact of solving this? (cost savings, revenue, efficiency)"

**3. Technical Environment:**
- "What systems are currently in use? (ERP, MES, etc.)"
- "Do these systems have APIs or data export capabilities?"
- "Is your team open to modern cloud-based tools or must it be on-premise?"

**4. Current State:**
- "Can you walk me through what exists today?"
- "Would love to see a demo of what's working"
- "What have you built so far vs. what's on the roadmap?"

**5. Timeline & Budget:**
- "What's the timeline you're envisioning?"
- "Is there budget allocated for this project?"
- "Are you looking for a phased approach or all-at-once implementation?"

**6. Decision-Making:**
- "Who else would be involved in evaluating and implementing this?"
- "What's the approval process for moving forward?"
- "Have you explored other solutions or partners?"

## Your Recommended Approach with Sajid

**DO:**
- ✅ Lead with AI automation and workflow integration expertise
- ✅ Ask lots of questions to understand their specific use case
- ✅ Be honest: "I don't have manufacturing background, but I've successfully automated complex workflows in other industries. If the problem is workflow/data integration, I can likely help."
- ✅ Reference proven work: GFCU compliance automation (100% accuracy), roofing lead systems
- ✅ Propose paid discovery/scoping ($3-5K, 2-3 weeks) to properly assess fit
- ✅ Emphasize Claude Code as your "manufacturing subject matter expert on demand"
- ✅ Mention 365 Digital ERP project for credibility

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Pretend you have manufacturing experience you don't have
- ❌ Commit to deliverables before you understand scope
- ❌ Agree to spec work or free proof-of-concepts (your runway doesn't allow it)
- ❌ Oversell capabilities on technical details you'd need to research
- ❌ Use manufacturing jargon incorrectly (better to ask than fake it)

## Go/No-Go Criteria for Moving Forward

### 🟢 GREEN LIGHTS (High Probability of Success)
- Workflow/process automation needs (your strength zone)
- Systems have APIs or data access
- They value business outcomes over technical credentials
- Open to paid discovery phase
- Timeline is Q2 2026 or later (gives you time to learn)
- Project budget is $15K+ (justifies learning investment)
- Collaborative and willing to educate you on domain
- Sajid appreciates your honest positioning

### 🟡 YELLOW LIGHTS (Proceed with Caution)
- Quick turnaround needed (4-6 weeks)
- Budget is $5-10K (tight for learning curve)
- Technical questions about manufacturing systems you don't know
- Scope seems large/complex (multi-system integration)
- Competitive bid situation
- Requires on-site factory floor work
- Expect manufacturing domain expertise

**Response:** Ask for paid discovery phase to de-risk. If they decline, probably not the right fit.

### 🔴 RED LIGHTS (High Risk - Likely Pass)
- Expect you to have manufacturing background
- Project involves hardware/machinery programming (PLCs, robotics)
- No budget for discovery - want spec work or free proposal
- Timeline is 2-3 weeks for delivery
- Legacy systems with no data access/APIs
- Regulated industry with compliance requirements you don't understand
- Skeptical of AI or Claude Code approach
- Budget under $5K

**Response:** Politely decline or refer to someone with manufacturing expertise. Protect your runway.

---

## Financial Context

**Your Current Situation:**
- Cash: $7,500
- Runway: 4-5 weeks
- Ben meeting Thu (higher cash priority - $5-20K)
- Retarget IQ delivery (already paid $4,500)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Can't afford lengthy discovery with no pay
- CAN afford paid discovery ($3-5K, 2-3 weeks) alongside other work
- Shouldn't distract from Ben meeting or Retarget IQ delivery

**Recommendation:**
- Position for paid discovery ONLY at this stage
- Don't commit to full implementation without runway

## Email Template for Joe Follow-Up (if positive)

**Subject:** Re: Ramp Manufacturing - Ready to Connect with Sajid

Hi Joe,

Thanks for the background on Sajid and RAMP! Based on our conversation, this sounds like it could be a really interesting fit.

I'd love to set up a call with Sajid to dive deeper into:
- The specific workflow challenges they're looking to solve
- What exists today vs. what needs to be built
- Technical environment and integration requirements
- Timeline and budget

My proposed approach would be a **paid discovery engagement** ($3-5K, 2-3 weeks) where I'd:
- Learn their systems and processes
- Document current workflows and identify automation opportunities
- Deliver a detailed recommendation with effort estimates
- Build a proof-of-concept if appropriate

This de-risks it for everyone and gives Sajid a valuable deliverable regardless of whether we move forward with full implementation.

Let me know the best way to connect with him!

Thanks again for thinking of me on this.

Best,
Dereck

## Conversation Approach with Joe

**Start warm and grateful:**
"Hey Joe, thanks for thinking of me on this RAMP opportunity. I read through the document and have some questions before I talk to Sajid. Got a few minutes?"

**Keep it casual but direct:**
- Don't make him feel interrogated
- Frame as "help me understand so I position this right"

**Be honest about your situation:**
"I'm intrigued but want to make sure I can actually deliver value given I don't have manufacturing background"

**Ask for his advice:**
"How would you approach the conversation with Sajid?"

---

## Post-Call Action Items

**Immediately After Call with Joe:**
1. Document what you learned
2. Update this prep doc with Joe's insights
3. Decide: Proceed to Sajid call OR politely decline
4. If proceeding: Draft questions for Sajid based on Joe's intel
5. Update FOCUS.md with priority/status

**Key Decision:**
Does this opportunity justify time/energy given:
- Ben meeting Thursday (highest cash priority)
- Fraser meeting Wednesday (clear $5-6K opportunity)
- 365 meeting Friday (strategic $20-40K potential)
- Retarget IQ delivery deadline

**RAMP could be $3-5K discovery OR too early/risky** - Joe's intel will tell you which.
