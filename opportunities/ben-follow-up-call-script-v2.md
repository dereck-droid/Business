# Ben/EquityPro Follow-Up Call Script (CRM Replacement)

**Date:** January 30, 2026 (Thursday afternoon)
**Purpose:** Present GHL CRM solution for full CRM replacement
**Goal:** Get commitment to move forward with 30-day implementation

**Tone:** Consultative, warm, direct - he already trusts you

---

## OPENING

"Hey Ben, thanks for taking the time yesterday. I've thought through the CRM replacement and have a solid approach for you. Got about 15 minutes?"

---

## THE SOLUTION

"So here's what I'm recommending for replacing your Drupal CRM:

**GoHighLevel as your complete CRM platform.** It handles everything you mentioned:

- **Seller AND Buyer pipelines** - both fully customized for your flow
- **All 15 team members** with role-based permissions - everyone sees only what they need
- **Centralized communications** - Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS, Email all in one interface
- **Website integration** - leads come in, immediately engaged via SMS/email
- **Missed call text back** - automatic
- **Video-to-text** - GHL does this natively, so that's covered
- **Team performance tracking** - dashboards showing conversion rates, activity
- **Buy box filtering** for your investors - match properties to interested buyers automatically

**Email Marketing Migration:**

We'll migrate you off Constant Contact - their API and webhook functionality is too limited for what you need.

- **SmartLead** for any cold/outbound campaigns - built-in warmup, deliverability protection
- **GHL** for warm/inbound lead nurturing
- We'll set up all domains and inboxes properly

**And the big one** - endless API capabilities. So when you're ready for that live lead pull system for Lis Pendens, or anything else you dream up, the infrastructure is there to build on."

---

## PRICING

"For the complete CRM replacement - both pipelines, 15 users, email migration, training, everything - the investment is $19,500.

Normally I'd price this scope and timeline at $25,000, but I'm offering you priority pricing because I value our relationship and I'm looking forward to the future work we'll do together - like that live lead pull system."

---

## PAYMENT OPTIONS

"I know budget's tight, so here are your payment options:

**Option A: 4 Monthly Payments** (Easiest on cash flow)
- $4,875/month for 4 months
- Even though the work completes in 30 days

**Option B: 50/50**
- $9,750 at start, $9,750 at completion

**Option C: 3 Payments**
- $7,800 / $5,850 / $5,850 over the 30 days

Which structure works best for you?"

---

## ADDRESSING THE DRUPAL INVESTMENT

*Only if he brings it up:*

"I know you've invested heavily in the Drupal system. Here's the reality - it gets you about a third of the way there, which means you're leaving significant revenue on the table. At $19,500, this is a fraction of what you've already spent, and it gets you to 100% functional."

---

## CLOSING

"Based on what we discussed yesterday, does moving forward with $19,500 and [his chosen payment option] work for you?"

**[SILENCE - let him respond]**

---

## IF HE SAYS YES

"Perfect. I'll send the agreement over this afternoon. Once you sign and we get the first payment, I'll kick off immediately so we hit that 30-day mark for your team presentation."

---

## IF HE NEEDS TO THINK / CONSULT TEAM

"That makes sense. What specific information does your team need?"

[Provide whatever needed]

"When works to reconnect after you've had a chance to discuss?"

[Pin down specific date/time]

---

## IF HE HAS BUDGET CONCERNS

"I understand. What would work better for your situation?

**Options:**
- Extend to 60-day timeline for $16,500 (removes rush premium)
- Phase it: Core CRM $15K now, advanced features later
- Stick with $19,500 but use the 4 monthly payment option to spread it out"

---

## NEXT STEPS

**If He Commits:**
1. Send agreement (within 2 hours)
2. Request first payment
3. Schedule kickoff call (within 48 hours)
4. Request CRM data export, website and Constant Contact access

**If He Needs Proposal:**
1. Send detailed proposal (already prepared)
2. Schedule follow-up (specific date)

---

## SECONDARY PROJECT MENTION

*Only if natural in conversation:*

"And once we get the CRM foundation solid, we can tackle that live lead pull system for Lis Pendens - checking every 5 minutes, automatically routing to your best guy. But first things first."

---

## DON'T FORGET

- This is warm - he already trusts you
- Don't oversell - keep it direct and consultative
- Emphasize future partnership ("look forward to working together")
- Payment flexibility solves his cash concern
- Let silence work after asking for the commitment

---

**You're helping him escape a system that cost $100K+ but only delivers 33%. Present confidently.**
