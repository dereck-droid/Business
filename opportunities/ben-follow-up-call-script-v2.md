# Ben/EquityPro Follow-Up Call Script (CRM Replacement)

**Date:** January 30, 2026 (Thursday afternoon)
**Purpose:** Present GHL CRM solution and pricing for full CRM replacement
**Goal:** Get commitment to move forward with 30-day implementation

---

## OPENING

"Hey Ben, thanks for taking the time yesterday. I've done the research we discussed on GoHighLevel for your CRM replacement, plus looked into the video-to-text and email marketing questions. I've got some good news. Do you have about 15 minutes?"

---

## RESEARCH FINDINGS

### Video-to-Text Capability

"So first, the video-to-text integration you asked about. GHL supports MMS natively, which means you can send videos via text. There are a couple of ways to approach this:

**Option 1:** Use GHL's native MMS with hosted videos (Vimeo, YouTube, custom hosting)
- Videos hosted externally, MMS sends the link with preview
- Cost: $0.02 per MMS (vs $0.0079 for SMS)
- Works across all carriers

**Option 2:** Integrate with specialty tools like BombBomb or Vidyard
- More polished video experience
- Better tracking and analytics
- Additional monthly cost ($30-80/month depending on volume)

**My recommendation:** [Based on actual research - need to do this]

### Email Marketing (Constant Contact Replacement)

"For potentially replacing Constant Contact:

GHL has a robust email builder with:
- Drag-and-drop template creation (perfect for property flyers)
- List segmentation and management
- Deliverability monitoring
- A/B testing
- Full reporting

**The question is deliverability for your 10,000+ investor list:**
- [Need to research GHL's email sending limits and deliverability]
- [Compare to Constant Contact's infrastructure]

**My recommendation:** [Based on actual research]

Alternatively, we could integrate Constant Contact with GHL so you keep the email infrastructure you trust while managing everything from one CRM."

## THE GHL CRM SOLUTION

"Based on everything you shared yesterday, here's how GoHighLevel solves what your Drupal CRM can't:

### Centralized Communications
One of the biggest wins is that ALL your communications come into one interface:
- Facebook Messenger
- WhatsApp
- SMS
- Email

Your team never has to juggle multiple platforms. Everything's in one conversation thread per contact.

### Immediate Lead Engagement
When a lead hits your website, GHL can:
- Automatically create the contact
- Send immediate SMS/email
- Trigger missed call text back if they call and you miss it
- Route to the right team member based on your rules

### Seller AND Buyer Management

**For Sellers:**
- Custom pipeline for your acquisition process
- Track marketing campaigns and ROI
- Automated follow-up sequences
- Team member assignment

**For Buyers/Investors:**
- Detailed profiles with buy box criteria
- Filter by property preferences (location, price, type, etc.)
- Track purchase history
- Automatically match new properties to interested investors
- Mass communication for new deals (property flyers via email/SMS)

### Team Management (15 Users)
- Role-based permissions - literally 50+ checkboxes of what each person can/can't do
- Admin vs User levels
- Each team member gets their own private contact list
- Performance dashboards showing conversion rates
- Lead assignment automation

### Future Capabilities
The API functionality you mentioned - this is where GHL shines. We can build literally anything you can imagine:
- Custom automations
- Integrations with any tool
- And they're at the forefront of Voice AI, which we discussed yesterday

So when that technology is ready, you'll be positioned to implement it immediately."

---

## PAYMENT OPTIONS (Flexible for Cash Flow)

"I know you mentioned budget is tight, so I've structured several payment options:

**Option A: 50/50**
- $9,750 at start
- $9,750 at completion (Day 30)

**Option B: 4 Monthly Payments (Recommended)**
- $4,875/month for 4 months
- Even though the work completes in 30 days
- Spreads the investment to help with cash flow

**Option C: Milestone-Based**
- Payment 1 (Start): $7,800 (40%)
- Payment 2 (Mid-project - Day 15): $5,850 (30%)
- Payment 3 (Completion - Day 30): $5,850 (30%)

Which structure works best for EquityPro?"

---

## MONTHLY ONGOING COSTS

"After setup, your only ongoing cost for GoHighLevel is $297/month paid directly to them. That includes:
- Unlimited contacts
- All 15+ users
- All platform features
- Regular updates

Plus usage-based costs for SMS/MMS, which you're already paying somewhere anyway."

---

## ADDRESSING THE DRUPAL INVESTMENT

"I know you've invested hundreds of thousands in your current Drupal CRM. That's a tough pill to swallow. But here's the reality:

You said yourself it only gets you about a third of the way there. That means you're leaving two-thirds of potential revenue on the table because your tech can't keep up.

At $19,500, this is a fraction of what you've already spent, and it gets you to 100% functional - not 33%. Plus, no more ongoing custom development fees just to add basic features."

---

## CLOSING

### Direct Ask

"Based on what we discussed yesterday and the research I've done, does moving forward with the $19,500 investment and [payment option] work for you?"

**[SILENCE - let him respond]**

### If He Says YES

"Excellent. I'll send over the agreement this afternoon. Once signed and we get the first payment, I'll kick off immediately so we can hit that 30-day mark for your team presentation."

### If He Needs to Think / Consult Team

"That makes sense. What specific information does your team need to make the decision?"

[Provide whatever they need]

"When would be good to reconnect after you've had a chance to discuss?"

[Pin down specific date/time - don't let drift]

### If He Has Budget Concerns

"I understand budget is tight. A couple options:

**Phase it:**
- Phase 1: Core CRM setup (seller + buyer pipelines, team accounts) - $12,000
- Phase 2: Advanced features (video-to-text, advanced automation) - $7,500
- Start generating value immediately, fund Phase 2 from improved efficiency

**Extend timeline:**
- If we extend to 60 days instead of the rush 30-day timeline, I can do $16,500
- Gives you more breathing room on budget

**Maintain 4-month payments:**
- Even at $19,500, spreading it over 4 months is $4,875/month
- Less than you're probably spending on inefficiency from the current system

What makes most sense for your situation?"

## SECONDARY PROJECT TEASER

"One more thing - that live lead pull system we discussed for Lis Pendens and foreclosures. That's absolutely doable and I'm excited about it. But I'd recommend we get the CRM foundation right first so when those leads start flooding in every 5 minutes, you have the infrastructure to handle them properly.

Once the CRM is live, we can build that system as a phase 2 project. But first things first - let's get you off that Drupal system and onto something that actually works."
