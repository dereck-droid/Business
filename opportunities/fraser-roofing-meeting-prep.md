## Meeting Context

**How You Connected:**
- Met them at a restaurant during team meeting (bold approach!)
- Approached owner, pitched database reactivation to book daily inspections
- Owner got excited, grabbed Jeff (manager) before he could leave
- Owner said: "If he's legit, I'll pay for it - move forward"
- Initial call with local branch sales manager (didn't go anywhere)
- Continued reaching out periodically
- Finally connected with Scott (Director of Sales for entire company)

**Previous Call with Scott:**
- Scott missed scheduled Zoom but called directly to apologize
- Said: "I clearly am interested and want to talk to you because I called you" - STRONG BUYING SIGNAL
- **He's really interested in voice AI/AI call center capabilities**
- You recommended starting with **AI SMS** instead
- He was totally fine with that approach
- **Specific request: wants SMS to be "blue for Apple users" (iMessage)**
- You told him it would be added cost but no problem

**Scott's Homework for You:**
1. Research **Acculynx** (their roofing CRM) to verify backend functionality
2. Set up meeting for "not next week, but the following" = week of Jan 27

## Value Proposition

**Database Reactivation for Roofing Companies:**

**Their Problem:**
- 16 years of dormant leads in database
- Every lead cost money to acquire initially (marketing, ads, referrals)
- Most leads went cold after initial contact or estimate
- Sitting on potential revenue they've already paid for

**Your Solution:**
- AI-powered SMS reactivation campaigns
- Automated conversation and qualification at scale
- Books inspections directly on their calendar
- Revenue without new marketing spend

**ROI Estimates (Conservative):**
- Average job value: ~$9,200
- Database size: 2,000-5,000 contacts
- Conservative reactivation: 2-3% conversion
- Conservative: $184K-414K additional annual revenue
- Realistic: $561K (61 jobs at $9,200 average)
- Best case: $1.38M (150 jobs)

**Proven Track Record:**
- Similar roofing company: Booking ~1 inspection per day from database reactivation

## Pre-Meeting Research (Action Items)

### 1. Acculynx API Research (2-3 hours)

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- ✅ Can you export/access their contact database?
- ✅ Does Acculynx have API or data export capabilities?
- ✅ What data fields are available? (name, phone, email, address, job history, estimate status, etc.)
- ✅ Can you integrate for real-time data sync or is it batch export only?
- ✅ Webhook capabilities for triggering automations?

**Research Sources:**
- Acculynx documentation
- Acculynx API docs (if publicly available)
- Community forums or integration examples
- Contact Acculynx support if needed

**What You Need to Tell Scott:**
"I researched Acculynx and [here's what's possible]. We can [export/integrate/sync] your contact database with these fields: [list]. This gives us everything we need to run effective AI SMS campaigns."

### 2. iMessage/RCS Pricing Research (1 hour)

**Scott's Request:** "Blue for Apple users"

**What This Means:**
- Apple Business Messages (iMessage for business)
- RCS (Rich Communication Services) for Android
- Better deliverability and engagement than standard SMS
- Higher perceived legitimacy (blue bubble = trusted)

**Research:**
- Apple Business Messages setup cost
- Per-message pricing vs. standard SMS
- Technical requirements and timeline
- RCS capabilities and pricing
- Providers who support both (Twilio, etc.)

**Ballpark Estimate:**
- Setup fee: +$500-1,000 (on top of base)
- Per-message cost: Slightly higher than SMS
- Worth it for better engagement and deliverability

## Meeting Structure (45 minutes)

### Opening (5 min)
"Scott, great to finally connect properly! I've done the homework you asked for on Acculynx and the iMessage capability. Let me walk you through what I found, then I'd love to understand more about your database and what success looks like."

**Tone:** Confident, consultative, excited about the opportunity

### Present Findings (10 min)

**Acculynx Integration:**
"Here's what I found with Acculynx: [your findings]
- We can access your contact database with these fields: [list]
- Integration approach: [API or export]
- Timeline: [X weeks to set up]
- This gives us everything we need to run targeted AI SMS campaigns"

**iMessage Capability:**
"You asked about the blue bubble for Apple users - here's what that looks like:
- Apple Business Messages + RCS for Android
- Better deliverability and engagement (people trust blue messages)
- Additional cost: [$X setup + per-message fees]
- Worth it for the improved response rates we'll see
- I can include this or start with standard SMS and upgrade later"

### Discovery Questions (15 min)

**Database Sizing:**
- "How many contacts do you estimate in your database across all 6 locations?"
- "How far back does the data go? (You've been in business 16 years)"
- "What percentage are truly dormant vs. active pipeline?"

**Business Context:**
- "What's your average job value?" (Confirm ~$9,200 or get actual number)
- "How many inspections/jobs do you currently book per week?"
- "What would make this a home run for you? More inspections? Higher close rate? Both?"

**Segmentation:**
- "Are there specific customer types you want to target first?"
  - By location? (GA, SC, FL)
  - By service type? (residential only? commercial?)
  - By lead age? (last 6 months? last 2 years? all-time?)

**Decision-Making:**
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision? Just you or does owner need to sign off?"
- "What's the approval process for moving forward?"
- "If we can demonstrate clear ROI, what's the timeline to launch?"

**Voice AI Interest:**
- "You mentioned interest in voice AI/call center. Is that immediate or future phase?"
- "Would you want to start with SMS and add voice later, or do both from the start?"

**ROI CALCULATOR (Show This):**
```
Database Size: [Scott's number, let's say 3,000]
Investment: $5,000-8,000
Cost per reactivated lead: $1

Conservative conversion: 2% = 60 jobs
Revenue: 60 jobs × $9,200 = $552,000

Even at 1% conversion = 30 jobs = $276,000 revenue
Investment pays for itself with 1 job ($9,200)

This is revenue you've ALREADY PAID to acquire these leads.
Now you're just re-engaging them at $1/contact.
```

### Close & Next Steps (5 min)

**Ask for the sale:**
"Based on what you're hearing, which approach makes the most sense for Fraser Roofing?"

**Handle Objections:**
- **"Need to think about it"** → "What questions do you still have? Let's address them now."
- **"Need to talk to owner"** → "Great! What information does the owner need to make this decision? I can provide a detailed proposal."
- **"Budget concerns"** → "Look at the ROI - one job pays for the entire setup. Everything after that is pure profit."

**Close Paths:**
1. **BEST:** "Let's do Option [X]. When can we get started?"
2. **GOOD:** "Send me the proposal and I'll get owner approval this week."
3. **OK:** "I need to talk to [person] first. Can we schedule a follow-up call for [specific date]?"

**Final Statement:**
"Scott, you've got 16 years of leads sitting there that you already paid to acquire. Every day we wait is revenue you're leaving on the table. Let's get this set up and start booking inspections."

## Objection Handling

**"That's expensive"**
→ "Let's look at ROI: Your average job is $9,200. This setup pays for itself with ONE job. Everything after that is pure profit from leads you already paid to acquire. Plus, with 2-3% conversion on even a modest database of 3,000 contacts, you're looking at 60-90 jobs = $550K-$830K in revenue. The $5K setup is 0.6% of that revenue potential."

**"We need to think about it"**
→ "Absolutely. What specific questions do you have? Let's make sure you have everything you need to make a confident decision."

**"Can you do a test first?"**
→ "We can! The $5K setup includes your first 5,000 contacts. That IS the test. If it doesn't work, you've proven it with data. But based on the roofing company we're already working with (booking ~1 inspection per day), I'm confident you'll see results."

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
→ "Great question. Here's what I see: You've got leads you already paid for sitting dormant. We're re-engaging them for $1/lead, which is a fraction of what you paid initially to acquire them. Even if we only reactivate 1% (which is conservative), you'll get 30 jobs = $276K revenue from a $5K investment. The risk is not trying it and letting that revenue continue to sit there."

**"Need owner approval"**
→ "Perfect! What does the owner need to see to approve this? I can provide:
- Detailed proposal
- ROI calculations based on your numbers
- Case study from similar roofing company
- Implementation timeline
What else would help?"

**"We're already doing marketing"**
→ "Exactly - and that's great! This isn't replacing your marketing. This is activating revenue from leads you ALREADY spent money to acquire. It's additive. You keep doing what's working, and this brings back leads that went cold. No new ad spend required."
