# AI Lead Reactivation Proposal
**Prepared for:** Ben Yonge, President | EquityPro Real Estate Investment
**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Prepared by:** Dereck Johnson | Advanced Lead Solutions

---

## Overview

This proposal outlines AI-powered lead reactivation services designed to convert your inactive database into qualified appointments with motivated sellers. Based on our October discussion, you have 8,000-10,000 leads that represent significant untapped revenue potential.

---

## Investment Options

### Option 1: Lead Reactivation Campaign
**Investment:** $8,000 - $10,000 (based on final lead count)

**Pricing Structure:**
- $1 per lead loaded into the system
- Split payment available: 50% upfront, 50% at day 30

**What's Included:**
- GoHighLevel setup and A2P 10DLC registration
- Custom AI conversation flow for motivated seller outreach
- Lead data import, cleaning, and deduplication
- AI-powered SMS/email engagement at scale
- Appointment scheduling automation
- Real-time dashboard and reporting
- 60-90 minute discovery session with your sales team
- Training materials and live launch call
- 90 days of active campaign management

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks from contract to launch

---

### Option 2: Lead Reactivation + Sales Intelligence
**Investment:** $12,000 - $15,000

**Everything in Option 1, plus:**
- AI call summarization for every sales conversation
- Automatic CRM data extraction and entry
- Key insights flagged for follow-up
- Team performance analytics

**Real-World Scenario:**
Your acquisition specialist gets a motivated seller on the phone. The conversation covers property condition, seller timeline, motivation factors, comparable sales in the area, and repair estimates. After the call, instead of manually typing notes into your CRM, the AI instantly extracts:
- Property address and condition details
- Seller's timeline and motivation (divorce, relocation, etc.)
- Estimated ARV and repair costs discussed
- Next follow-up date and specific objections to address

Your team lead sees this data in real-time, can coach on the call while it's fresh, and your closer has complete context when they follow up. No more "let me pull up the notes" or missed details that kill deals.

**Impact:** Higher close rates through better follow-up, reduced data entry time, improved team coaching

---

### Option 3: Ongoing Lead Management System
**Investment:** $8,000-$10,000 setup (database reactivation) + $1,000/month ongoing

**What This Includes:**
- Complete database reactivation (same as Option 1)
- Plus: Continuous AI qualification of all new inbound leads
- Automatic re-engagement of non-responsive leads over 30-60 day nurture
- 24/7 lead response and qualification (under 5 minutes)
- Monthly lead quality scoring and reporting
- Ongoing optimization based on performance data

**How It Works:**
We start by reactivating your 8,000-10,000 inactive leads (same as Option 1). Then, for all future leads that come in from marketing, the system automatically engages within 5 minutes → Qualifies interest and timeline → Books appointments with qualified sellers → Continues nurturing non-responsive leads → Only passes sales-ready appointments to your team.

**Impact:** Never miss a lead, reduce response time to under 5 minutes, continuous pipeline development from both old database AND new leads, team only talks to qualified sellers

**Note:** The setup cost ($8,000-$10,000) covers the initial database reactivation based on your lead count. The monthly fee ($1,000) covers ongoing management of all NEW leads coming from your marketing.
