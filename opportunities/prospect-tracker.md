- **Delivery:** By Jan 31, 2026
- **Scope:** Proposal automation + tech support chat interface

### 4. RAMP Manufacturing - AI in Mfg. Workflows 🔍

**Company:** RAMP Manufacturing (www.rampmfg.com)
**Contact:** Sajid Patel (via Joe - referral partner)
**Relationship:** Referral from Joe (15+ years in product dev/manufacturing launches)

**🎯 DISCOVERY CALL: Monday, January 27, 2026 @ 10:00 AM (with Joe)**

**What Joe Shared:**
- Sajid is Managing Director at Deloitte (Chicago, IL)
- Former CEO of Optimal Design (product engineering services) - acquired by Deloitte
- 20+ years in manufacturing/product engineering
- Now founder of RAMP Manufacturing
- Sajid sent NDA (signed, confidential)
- Seeking assistance with "AI in mfg. Workflows"

**RAMP's Vision (from document):**
AI platform for manufacturing launches covering:
1. **DFM Analysis** - Automated design-for-manufacturability reviews
2. **Smart Work Instructions** - Auto-generate from CAD/BOMs, real-time updates
3. **Testing Acceleration** - AI-assisted test plans, scripts, validation
4. **Skill Matching** - Map operator skills to station requirements

**The Mystery - What We DON'T Know:**
- What actually exists vs. what's aspirational?
- What do they need YOU to build specifically?
- Is this concept, prototype, or production platform?
- Why bring in outside technical help?
- Is there budget/timeline?
- Is this funded work or speculative development?

**Manufacturing AI Market Context (2026):**
- 98% of manufacturers exploring AI, only 20% prepared
- Market: $5.2B (2024) → $200B by 2034
- Top need: Workflow automation across disparate systems (YOUR STRENGTH!)

**Your Positioning:**
- **Strengths:** AI automation, workflow integration, n8n mastery, Claude Code
- **Gaps:** ZERO manufacturing experience (no factory floor, PLCs, SCADA, MES)
- **Approach:** "I'm the expert in automation. You guide on manufacturing domain, I apply AI expertise."
- **Additional Credibility:** "I'm discussing ERP plugin for manufacturing with 365 Digital (Friday meeting)"

**Joe Call Purpose:**
- Extract intel on what Sajid actually needs
- Understand current state vs. vision
- Assess budget/timeline reality
- Determine if worth pursuing

**Go/No-Go Criteria:**

**🟢 GREEN LIGHTS (Proceed):**
- Workflow/process automation focus (your strength)
- Systems have APIs/data access
- Open to paid discovery ($3-5K, 2-3 weeks)
- Timeline Q2+ (allows learning)
- Budget $15K+
- Collaborative, willing to educate you

**🔴 RED LIGHTS (Pass):**
- Expect manufacturing domain expertise
- Hardware/PLC programming required
- No budget for discovery
- Timeline 2-3 weeks
- Budget under $5K
- Skeptical of AI/Claude Code approach

**Proposed Approach (if green lights):**
**Paid Discovery Engagement:** $3-5K, 2-3 weeks
- Learn their systems and processes (with Claude Code support)
- Document workflows, identify automation opportunities
- Deliver recommendation report with ROI
- Build POC if appropriate
- De-risks for both parties

**Meeting Prep Doc:** `/opportunities/joe-ramp-manufacturing-prep.md`
**Full Analysis:** `/opportunity-analysis-ramp-manufacturing.md`

**Opportunity:** $3,000-5,000+ paid discovery (potential $15-50K+ full implementation)
**Close Probability:** 50% (many unknowns, depends on Joe's intel)
**Days to Cash:** 21-30 days (discovery call → Sajid call → proposal → deposit)
**Strategic Value:** 7/10 (entry to manufacturing vertical, elite-level contact)

**Critical Context:**
- Don't let this distract from Ben (Thu) or Fraser (Wed) - they're higher cash priority
- This is strategic exploration, not survival mode opportunity
- Your $7.5K cash and 4-5 week runway means you can't afford spec work
- Position for PAID DISCOVERY ONLY at this stage

**Next Actions:**
1. 🎯 **Mon 10am:** Joe call - extract intel, assess fit
2. ⏳ **After Joe call:** Decide proceed to Sajid OR politely decline
3. ⏳ **If proceed:** Draft questions for Sajid based on Joe's insights
4. ⏳ **If green lights:** Propose paid discovery framework

**Company:** 365 Digital
**Contacts:** Bill (Guillermo) and Elaine Avila
**Relationship:** Intro call December 2025, sent NDA immediately after

**🎯 MEETING SCHEDULED: Friday, January 31, 2026**

**Company Profile:**
- **Founded:** ~7 years ago (May 2019)
- **Founders:** Bill (from Accenture consulting) + Elaine (operations)
- **Faith-Based:** Former pastors/church planters, now focused on business
- **Services:**
  1. Enterprise ERP Project Management (Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O)
  2. Project Rescues ($4M+ overruns typical)
  3. Organizational Change Management (explosive growth in 2025)

**Client Base:**
- Life sciences (pharma, biotech, medical devices)
- Multimillion-dollar companies
- Long engagements: 1-2 years typical
- After implementations, clients want them to stay for more work

**The AI/ERP Opportunity:**
After ERP implementations, develop AI applications that layer ON TOP of ERP systems to fill gaps.

**Example Use Case Bill Described:**
- BMW truck demand forecasting
- Current: Manual planning → often wrong → wasted costs
- AI Solution: Historical data analysis → predict actual output → optimize scheduling
- Impact: Reduce costs, improve planning accuracy

**Technology Approach:**
- Applications on top of Microsoft Dynamics F&O
- Azure ML (Microsoft's platform)
- Python: Prophet (forecasting), scikit-learn (ML)
- Applied ML, not novel AI from scratch
- Focus: Predictive analytics, forecasting, workflow automation

**What They Need:**
- Strategic thinker who understands operations (not just coder)
- Can interview stakeholders and translate to technical requirements
- AI automation architect
- Partner who can grow with them

**Why You're A Fit (Despite Doubts):**
- Business operations mastery (8 years music school)
- Enterprise-grade delivery (GFCU 100% accuracy)
- High communication skills (can interview stakeholders)
- Wonder + Discernment combo (spot opportunities, evaluate solutions)
- Track record of mastering complex domains

**Bill's Own Story (Confidence Booster):**
"Elaine and I never ran a business before, and we kind of figured it out as we went along."
→ 7 years later: Multi-million dollar enterprise consulting firm

**Discovery Phase Structure (Bill's Words):**
"Your design period is probably an eight to 16-week engagement just for design. And that means getting in there, interviewing the business, finding out how they run their process."
- **Translation:** You get PAID ($20-40K) for 8-16 weeks to LEARN their systems. That's the job.

**What's Changed Since December:**
- It's been ~2 months
- You now have manufacturing context (RAMP discussions Monday)
- You've closed deals (Retarget IQ $4.5K)
- More confidence and momentum
- Paid discovery framework refined

- [ ] ERP/Dynamics 365 basics (2 hours)

- [ ] Re-read December transcript
- [ ] Review 365 Digital website/LinkedIn
- [ ] Prepare discovery questions

**Your Positioning for Meeting:**
"Since we last talked, I've been diving deeper into manufacturing and ERP opportunities. Actually meeting with another contact this week about ERP plugin for manufacturing/shipping workflows (RAMP), so timing is perfect. My approach: I'm the expert in AI automation, I partner with domain experts (like you) for manufacturing/ERP knowledge."

**Proposed Discovery Engagement:**
- 8-16 weeks
- $20,000-40,000 investment
- Deliverables: Workflow documentation, AI opportunity assessment, technical architecture, POC, implementation roadmap
- De-risks for everyone

**Meeting Prep Doc:** `/opportunities/365-digital-meeting-prep.md`

**Opportunity:** $20,000-40,000 (discovery phase) + $50-100K+ (implementation)
**Close Probability:** 60% (if specific funded project exists)
**Days to Cash:** 30-45 days (meeting → proposal → contract → deposit)
**Strategic Value:** 8/10 (enterprise-level, career-changing, new vertical)

**Critical Context:**
- Longest timeline to cash (not survival mode)
- Highest learning curve
- Biggest strategic upside
- Less urgent than Fraser/Ben
- OK to pass if red flags appear

**Next Actions:**
1. 📈 **Tue-Thu:** Complete ERP/ML research
2. 📈 **Friday:** Meeting - understand specific opportunity, assess fit
3. ⏳ **After meeting:** Decide proceed OR pass based on:
   - Is there a specific funded client project?
   - Does timeline/budget match scope?
   - Do you have proper support/resources?
   - Does this move your business forward strategically?

## Notes & Strategy

**Current Financial Status:** 🔴 RED ZONE
- Focus on CLOSING deals, not generating new leads
- Warm leads = highest priority
- Cold outreach = background activity

**What's Working:**
- Network/referral opportunities (100% meeting conversion)
- Existing client expansion (Kin, Retarget IQ)
- Partnership opportunities (Retarget IQ, L2T)

**What's Not Working (Yet):**
- Cold email campaign (too early to tell)
- May need 7-14 days for responses

**Strategic Focus:**
1. Close immediate cash opportunities (Ben, Kin, L2T, 365)
2. Secure Lead Supercharger partnership (recurring revenue foundation)
3. Let pool campaign run in background
4. Build referral channels vs. cold outreach
