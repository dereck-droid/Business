## Notes & Strategy

**Current Financial Status:** 🔴 RED ZONE
- Focus on CLOSING deals, not generating new leads
- Warm leads = highest priority
- Cold outreach = background activity

**What's Working:**
- Network/referral opportunities (100% meeting conversion)
- Existing client expansion (Kin, Retarget IQ)
- Partnership opportunities (Retarget IQ, L2T)

**What's Not Working (Yet):**
- Cold email campaign (too early to tell)
- May need 7-14 days for responses

**Strategic Focus:**
1. Close immediate cash opportunities (Ben, Kin, L2T, 365)
2. Secure Lead Supercharger partnership (recurring revenue foundation)
3. Let pool campaign run in background
4. Build referral channels vs. cold outreach
