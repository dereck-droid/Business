## Full CRM Replacement for EquityPro

**Prepared for:** Ben, EquityPro
**Prepared by:** Dereck Johnson
**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Project Timeline:** 30 days to team presentation

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive CRM replacement strategy to address the limitations of your current custom Drupal system. After our discussion, it's clear that despite significant investment ($100K+), your current CRM only gets you "about a third of the way there" for managing both your seller acquisition and buyer disposition operations effectively.

**The Solution:** Implement and customize GoHighLevel as your complete CRM platform to manage sellers, buyers/investors, team members, and all communications from one centralized system.

**Investment:** [To be determined based on final scope]
**Timeline:** 30 days to operational system ready for team presentation
**Team Size:** 15 users with role-based permissions

---

## The Challenge

Your current custom Drupal CRM has significant limitations:

- **Incomplete Functionality** - Despite hundreds of thousands invested, it only delivers ~33% of what you need
- **No Full Automation** - Can't fully capitalize on seller leads OR buyer opportunities
- **Limited Communication Tools** - No integrated text/call/email from platform
- **No Buyer Management** - Can't filter by buy box, track purchase history effectively
- **Team Management Issues** - 15 team members need different permission levels and private contact lists
- **Ongoing Development Costs** - Continuous custom programming required just to add basic features

**Bottom Line:** You're leaving significant revenue on the table because your tech stack can't keep up with your business model.

## Secondary Project Discussion: Live Lead Pull System

As discussed, there's significant opportunity to build a custom system that monitors Orange County (and other counties) public records in real-time for:

- Lis Pendens (pre-foreclosure)
- Other motivated seller indicators
- Updates every 5-10 minutes (vs monthly PropStream updates)
- Automatic CRM entry and team notification
- First-mover advantage on hot leads

**This is an exciting secondary project that we can explore after CRM implementation is complete.** Getting the CRM foundation right first ensures we have the infrastructure to handle these leads effectively when they come in.
