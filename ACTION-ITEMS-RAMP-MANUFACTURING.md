## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Before Monday Meeting)

### Weekend Prep (February 1-2)

**Priority: MEDIUM** (You have Retarget IQ work as priority, but need some prep)

**Time Required:** 2-3 hours total

#### [ ] Review Manufacturing Documentation Types (30 minutes)

**Why:** So you can speak intelligently about what they're trying to automate

**Key Terms to Know:**
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** - Step-by-step instructions for processes
- **Work Instructions** - Detailed task-level procedures for workers
- **Quality Control Procedures** - How to inspect/validate quality
- **Process Flow Diagrams** - Visual maps of manufacturing processes
- **Bill of Materials (BOM) Documentation** - Parts/components lists
- **Engineering Change Orders (ECOs)** - How changes are documented/approved

**Quick Research:**
- Google: "manufacturing SOP examples"
- Google: "manufacturing ramp-up documentation"
- Just enough to understand the vocabulary

#### [ ] Familiarize with Manufacturing Systems (30 minutes)

**Why:** They'll likely mention their tech stack

**Systems to Know About (high-level):**
- **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** - SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics (overall business management)
- **MES (Manufacturing Execution System)** - Tracks production on factory floor
- **PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)** - Manages product designs and engineering data
- **QMS (Quality Management System)** - Manages quality and compliance

**You Don't Need to Be Expert:** Just know what these acronyms mean

#### [ ] Review Your Relevant Examples (30 minutes)

**What to Prepare:**

**1. GFCU Compliance Automation:**
- 100% accuracy over 25 runs
- Vectorized database with metadata
- Complex policy checking logic
- Similar to what they need (document analysis + compliance)

**2. Any Workflow Automation Examples:**
- n8n workflows you've built
- Multi-system integrations
- Data extraction/transformation

**3. Document Generation Examples:**
- If you've automated any document creation
- Template-based generation with AI

**Purpose:** Have 2-3 concrete examples ready to share when asked "what have you built?"

#### [ ] Prepare Discovery Questions (30 minutes)

**Review the questions in the main opportunity doc:**
- Scope definition questions
- Current state questions
- Desired state questions
- Technical environment questions
- Business context questions
- Success metrics questions

**Don't memorize - just be familiar so they flow naturally**

#### [ ] Draft Paid Discovery Proposal Framework (30 minutes)

**Have this ready to share if the meeting goes well:**

**PHASE 1: Paid Discovery ($3,500 - $5,000 | 2-3 weeks)**
- Document current state workflows
- Map data sources and system integrations
- Identify automation opportunities
- Build proof-of-concept for one document type
- Deliver recommendation report with effort estimates

**Value Proposition:** "Low-risk way to validate approach, valuable deliverable regardless of next steps"

**PHASE 2: MVP Implementation ($15,000 - $30,000 | 6-8 weeks)**
*(Only if Phase 1 validates fit)*
- Build automated documentation pipeline for 2-3 core document types
- Integrate with their existing systems
- Train AI models on their documentation standards
- User interface for engineers to generate/review documents
- Testing and refinement

#### [ ] Quick Mental Prep (15 minutes)

**Review these key points before the call:**

**Your Positioning:**
- "I'm the AI automation expert who learns your domain and builds solutions"
- "I need you to teach me manufacturing specifics, I'll apply AI expertise"
- "Let's start with paid discovery to properly understand and validate"

**What Worked on the Call:**
- Your enthusiasm and energy
- Your problem-solving approach
- Your honesty about coming from different background
- They reciprocated enthusiasm - chemistry is good

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't pretend to know manufacturing jargon you don't
- Don't commit to specifics before understanding scope
- Don't agree to free spec work
- Don't let them rush you to a quote

**Green Light Signals to Listen For:**
- They have budget allocated
- Timeline is realistic (8+ weeks for implementation)
- They value your AI expertise over manufacturing knowledge
- They're open to paid discovery
- Problem is well-defined

**Red Flag Signals to Watch For:**
- Want free POC
- Need delivery in 2-3 weeks
- Expect you to be manufacturing expert
- Budget under $5K
- Shopping 10 vendors competitively

## MONDAY MEETING (February 3, 11:00 AM)

### Meeting Goals

**PRIMARY GOAL:** Understand the specific problem and assess if it's a good fit

**SECONDARY GOAL:** If it's a good fit, propose paid discovery engagement

**SUCCESS METRICS:**
- ✅ You understand exactly what they're trying to automate
- ✅ You know their timeline and budget constraints
- ✅ You feel confident you can deliver (or know you can't)
- ✅ Next steps are clear (paid discovery proposal or pass)

### Meeting Structure (60 minutes suggested)

**Opening (5 min):**
- Match their energy (they mentioned "energetic meeting!")
- Recap: "Great to connect after the impromptu call with Joe. I've been thinking about the manufacturing documentation challenge you described."

**Deep Dive Discovery (30 min):**

Use your discovery questions (see full doc for complete list):

**Key Questions to Prioritize:**
1. "Walk me through a specific example of the manufacturing ramp documentation process you're dealing with."
2. "What types of documents are we talking about? SOPs, work instructions, quality procedures?"
3. "How many documents typically required for a product ramp-up?"
4. "What's the current time/cost to create these documents manually?"
5. "What systems are you currently using?"
6. "Is this for RAMP's internal use, or are you building a solution to offer clients?"
7. "What's your timeline and do you have budget allocated?"

**Share Your Relevant Experience (10 min):**

**GFCU Example:**
"I built an AI system for a federal credit union that analyzes compliance documents with 100% accuracy. Similar challenge - complex logic, high-stakes automation, document analysis. That's very relevant to what you're describing."

**Approach Example:**
"My typical approach: I start with business outcomes, design backwards to technology. I don't just build cool AI - I build AI that solves measurable problems. That's why I'd recommend starting with paid discovery."

**Present Your Approach (10 min):**

"Here's how I'd approach this:

**PAID DISCOVERY PHASE ($3,500-5,000 | 2-3 weeks):**
- I'll document your current workflows
- Map your data sources and systems
- Build a proof-of-concept for one document type
- Deliver a recommendation report with clear effort estimates

This de-risks it for both of us. You get valuable deliverables regardless, and we validate the approach before committing to full implementation.

**IF discovery validates fit, PHASE 2 would be:**
- MVP implementation ($15-30K | 6-8 weeks)
- 2-3 core document types automated
- Integration with your existing systems
- Testing and refinement

Make sense?"

**Close & Next Steps (5 min):**
- "What would need to happen for us to move forward?"
- "What's your timeline?"
- "Any concerns or questions about this approach?"
