## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (This Week - Proposal Due Friday)

### Priority: HIGH (Proposal due in 3 days)

**Time Required:** 12-15 hours total

### [ ] Monday-Tuesday: Joe Partnership Conversation (30-60 minutes)

**CRITICAL: Have this conversation BEFORE finalizing proposal pricing**

**The Conversation:**
> "Joe, I want to make sure we're both compensated fairly on this. For discovery I'm thinking $7K with your 30% because you're actively involved 12-15 hours doing terminology translation, client meetings, and deliverable formatting. That gives you $2,100 for 12-15 hours, and me $4,900 for 40-50 hours.
>
> For implementation, your involvement drops to 5-10 hours of check-ins and support, so I'm thinking 15% makes more sense there (not 30%). If Phase 1 is $30K, you'd get $4,500 for that support work.
>
> Are you willing to put in that discovery time? If so, 30% for discovery feels fair. What do you think?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Sets clear expectations before pricing
- Joe earns 30% through active work (not just referral)
- Protects your economics on implementation
- Maintains good relationship with transparency

### [ ] Tuesday-Wednesday: Create Phase 0 Proposal (8-10 hours)

**Deadline:** Wednesday Feb 4 end of day (send to Joe for review)

**Must Include (from Joe K requirements):**

1. **Phase 0: Discovery Scope & Deliverables**
   - Document current workflow in detail
   - Engineer interviews through real project
   - Map automatable vs. manual components
   - Build POC for one document type/section
   - Feasibility report with Phase 1 recommendation and pricing
   - Timeline: 2-3 weeks
   - **Price: $6,500-$7,500**

2. **Architecture Approach**
   - Database selection and justification
   - Hosting options (local server vs. private cloud)
   - AI model access (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini)
   - Why multiple models (different strengths for different tasks)
   - User interface for image upload and metadata

3. **Security Approach**
   - Enterprise AI contracts (no training on customer data)
   - Encrypted input/output
   - Secure database architecture
   - Customer IP protection measures
   - RAMP knowledge base ownership

4. **Licensing Requirements**
   - AI model subscriptions needed
   - Estimated monthly costs
   - Database hosting costs
   - Any other software/tools required

5. **Where It Runs**
   - Cloud vs. local server options
   - Pros/cons of each
   - Recommended approach with justification
   - Scalability considerations

6. **What's Off-the-Shelf vs. Custom**
   - AI models: Off-the-shelf (Claude API, etc.)
   - Database: Off-the-shelf (Supabase, etc.)
   - Workflow automation: Custom (n8n workflows)
   - User interface: Custom build
   - Knowledge base logic: Custom

7. **Team Composition & Roles**
   - Dereck Johnson: AI/Automation Technical Expert (40-50 hours)
   - Joe Brennan: Manufacturing Industry Advisor (12-15 hours)
   - Team value proposition

**Positioning Language:**
> "For this discovery engagement, I'm partnering with Joe Brennan (15+ years in product development and manufacturing) to ensure we speak your language and deliver results in formats you're accustomed to. This team approach means faster discovery, better deliverables, and reduced risk."

**ROI Justification:**
- Engineers cost $80-150/hour fully loaded
- 2-6 weeks per project = 80-240 hours
- Current cost: $6,400-$36,000 per project in labor
- Discovery investment pays back in 1-2 projects
- If 50% time savings: 40-120 hours saved per project
- Annual savings potential (10-20 projects): $32K-$360K

### [ ] Wednesday Evening: Send to Joe B for Review

**Email to Joe:**
> "Joe, I've drafted the Phase 0 discovery proposal for RAMP. Can you review for manufacturing terminology and format it using your industry templates? We need to finalize by Friday morning.
>
> Also - did you get a chance to think about the partnership structure I mentioned? (30% discovery, 15% implementation). Let me know if you want to discuss."

**Attach:** Phase 0 proposal draft (Google Doc or similar for easy editing)

### [ ] Thursday: Joe Refines with Manufacturing Language (4-5 hours - Joe's work)

**What Joe Does:**
- Apply manufacturing terminology

## MONDAY MEETING (February 3, 11:00 AM)

### Meeting Goals

**PRIMARY GOAL:** Understand the specific problem and assess if it's a good fit

**SECONDARY GOAL:** If it's a good fit, propose paid discovery engagement

**SUCCESS METRICS:**
- ✅ You understand exactly what they're trying to automate
- ✅ You know their timeline and budget constraints
- ✅ You feel confident you can deliver (or know you can't)
- ✅ Next steps are clear (paid discovery proposal or pass)

### Meeting Structure (60 minutes suggested)

**Opening (5 min):**
- Match their energy (they mentioned "energetic meeting!")
- Recap: "Great to connect after the impromptu call with Joe. I've been thinking about the manufacturing documentation challenge you described."

**Deep Dive Discovery (30 min):**

Use your discovery questions (see full doc for complete list):

**Key Questions to Prioritize:**
1. "Walk me through a specific example of the manufacturing ramp documentation process you're dealing with."
2. "What types of documents are we talking about? SOPs, work instructions, quality procedures?"
3. "How many documents typically required for a product ramp-up?"
4. "What's the current time/cost to create these documents manually?"
5. "What systems are you currently using?"
6. "Is this for RAMP's internal use, or are you building a solution to offer clients?"
7. "What's your timeline and do you have budget allocated?"

**Share Your Relevant Experience (10 min):**

**GFCU Example:**
"I built an AI system for a federal credit union that analyzes compliance documents with 100% accuracy. Similar challenge - complex logic, high-stakes automation, document analysis. That's very relevant to what you're describing."

**Approach Example:**
"My typical approach: I start with business outcomes, design backwards to technology. I don't just build cool AI - I build AI that solves measurable problems. That's why I'd recommend starting with paid discovery."

**Present Your Approach (10 min):**

"Here's how I'd approach this:

**PAID DISCOVERY PHASE ($3,500-5,000 | 2-3 weeks):**
- I'll document your current workflows
- Map your data sources and systems
- Build a proof-of-concept for one document type
- Deliver a recommendation report with clear effort estimates

This de-risks it for both of us. You get valuable deliverables regardless, and we validate the approach before committing to full implementation.

**IF discovery validates fit, PHASE 2 would be:**
- MVP implementation ($15-30K | 6-8 weeks)
- 2-3 core document types automated
- Integration with your existing systems
- Testing and refinement

Make sense?"

**Close & Next Steps (5 min):**
- "What would need to happen for us to move forward?"
- "What's your timeline?"
- "Any concerns or questions about this approach?"
