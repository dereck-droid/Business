## Runway Calculation

**Formula:** (Current Cash - Immediate Bills) / ((Monthly Burn - Monthly MRR) / 4.33)

**Updated Scenario (Jan 25, 2026):**
- Cash: $7,500
- Immediate Bills (11 days): -$2,300
- **Cash After Bills:** $5,200
- Monthly Burn: $4,900
- Monthly MRR: $2,094
- **Net Monthly Deficit:** $2,806
- **Weekly Deficit:** $648
- **Runway:** $5,200 / $648 = **8.0 weeks** ✅

**Previous Scenario (Jan 20, 2026):**
- Cash: $3,000
- After Bills: $700
- Runway: 2-3 weeks 🔴

**Change:** +$4,500 revenue = +5 weeks runway = RED ZONE → GREEN ZONE!
