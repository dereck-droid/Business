- ben-equitypro-service-agreement.md (DRAFT - ready if needed)

**REFERENCE (Context):**
- ben-meeting-strategy-jan-30.md (Re-engagement strategy - CONFIRMED)

- ben-ghl-complexity-and-pricing-analysis.md (Internal analysis)

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Decision: Don't Create Demo Video Yet
**Reasoning:**
- Proposal already comprehensive (320 lines, addresses all concerns)
- Urgent client work (Retarget IQ, music school) has higher ROI
- Video can be created reactively if Ben requests (60-75 min)
- Ben hasn't responded yet - speculative work

**Next Action:** Create video only if Ben asks for it

---

## 📊 Ben/EquityPro Status

**Proposal Details:**
- Investment: $19,500
- Payment: 4 monthly payments of $4,875 (recommended)
- Timeline: 30 days to operational system
- Sent: January 31, 2026

**Addresses Ben's Concerns:**
- ✅ "Won't own it" → Ownership section (100%, transferable)
- ✅ "Don't know what it looks like" → Daily workflow examples
- ✅ Tools not unified → InvestorBase embedded in sidebar

**Next Actions:**
- Monday: Check for Ben's response
- Wednesday: Follow up if no response ("Any questions?")
- If requested: Create demo video (60-75 min turnaround)
