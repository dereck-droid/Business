# Advanced Lead Solutions - Knowledge Base

## Company Overview

**Business Name:** Advanced Lead Solutions (also known as Good Works Automation)
**Owner:** Dereck Johnson
**Location:** South Carolina
**Website:** advancedleadsolutions.com

**Mission Statement:**
"Less stress and more success for business owners by providing software and automation solutions."

**Value Proposition:**
We provide enterprise-level quality solutions for small to mid-sized businesses (5-25 person teams). We focus on outcomes and ROI, not just features. Our philosophy is that automation should enhance human capabilities, not replace relationships.

**Target Market:**
Small business owners with teams of 5-25 people who are already successful and ready to scale, but feeling the strain of growth. They want to expand without proportional time increase and value quality over quantity.

## Core Services

### 1. Database Reactivation Services

**What It Is:**
Re-engage dormant CRM leads using AI-powered automation to extract value from contacts that have gone cold.

**Pricing:**
- Setup: $2,500 - $5,000
- Performance Fee: $1 per qualified lead generated
- Target: B2C, high-ticket businesses with large databases (20,000+ contacts)

**How It Works:**
1. We analyze your existing CRM database to identify dormant leads
2. Create personalized, AI-driven outreach campaigns across multiple channels
3. Intelligently engage contacts based on their original intent and timeline
4. Qualify responses and route hot leads to your sales team
5. Track and optimize performance continuously

**Success Story - Fraser Roofing:**
A roofing company with 10,000+ old leads now books inspections daily from previously dead database contacts. The AI system identifies the best time to re-engage based on seasonal patterns and original inquiry type.

**Ideal For:**
- Businesses with 10,000+ CRM contacts
- High-ticket B2C companies (roofing, solar, pools, remodeling)
- Companies who previously spent heavily on lead generation
- Sales teams overwhelmed with new leads but leaving money on the table

**ROI Expectations:**
If you have 20,000 dormant leads and we reactivate just 1% (200 leads) at $1/lead, that's $200 in fees. If your close rate is 10% and average sale is $8,000, that's 20 sales = $160,000 in revenue. Setup cost pays for itself with 1-2 closed deals.

### 2. AI Assistant Implementation

**What It Is:**
Custom AI assistants integrated with your business systems to handle customer interactions via voice or chat.

**Pricing:**
- Monthly Subscription: $297/month
- 12-Month Prepay Option: $3,064 (saves $500)
- Includes: setup, integration, ongoing optimization, and support

**Capabilities:**
- Appointment scheduling and reminders
- Lead qualification and routing
- Customer support (FAQ answering)
- Order status inquiries
- Multi-channel (phone, website chat, SMS)
- CRM integration (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, others)
- Natural conversation with context awareness

**Use Cases:**
1. **Medical/Dental Practices:** Patient scheduling, insurance verification, appointment reminders
2. **Home Services:** Estimate requests, service scheduling, follow-up calls
3. **Real Estate:** Property inquiry qualification, showing scheduling
4. **Professional Services:** Consultation booking, client intake

**What Makes Ours Different:**
- Custom trained on YOUR business (not generic templates)
- Integrated with YOUR systems (CRM, calendar, payment processor)
- Ongoing optimization based on conversation analysis
- Professional voice quality (like you're experiencing now)
- Proper escalation to humans when needed

**ROI Expectations:**
If the AI handles 50 calls/week that would take your team 10 minutes each, that's 8.3 hours saved weekly. At $25/hour labor cost, you save $866/month. Service pays for itself in time savings alone, plus you never miss a lead again.

### 3. Workflow Automation Solutions

**What It Is:**
Automated multi-system workflows that eliminate manual, repetitive tasks and reduce human error.

**Pricing:**
- Project-based: $2,000 - $40,000+ depending on complexity
- Typical project: $5,000 - $15,000
- Some clients opt for monthly retainer: $500 - $3,000/month for ongoing automation work

**Technologies Used:**
- n8n (workflow automation platform)
- GoHighLevel integrations
- API connections between systems
- Custom webhooks and triggers
- Database automation

**Example Workflows:**
1. **Lead Routing:** New lead comes in → AI qualifies → Routes to appropriate sales rep → Creates CRM contact → Sends personalized follow-up → Books appointment
2. **Customer Onboarding:** Sale closes → Creates customer record → Sends welcome email → Schedules onboarding call → Creates project in management system → Notifies team
3. **Compliance Automation:** Document uploaded → AI extracts data → Checks against compliance rules → Flags issues → Routes for approval → Files in correct location (100% accuracy for GFCU client)

**Success Story - GFCU:**
Financial credit union needed 100% compliance accuracy for document processing. Our automation system processes documents, extracts data, checks compliance rules, and routes for approval - achieving perfect accuracy and saving 15+ hours per week.

**Ideal For:**
- Businesses doing the same manual tasks repeatedly
- Multi-system environments needing better connectivity
- Companies with data entry errors causing problems
- Teams spending hours on "administrative work"

**ROI Expectations:**
Typical workflow automation saves 10-20 hours per week. At $30/hour loaded cost, that's $15,600 - $31,200 per year in savings. Even a $15,000 project pays for itself in under a year, then continues saving forever.

### 4. Custom Software Development

**What It Is:**
Tailored software applications built specifically for your unique business needs.

**Pricing:**
- Range: $5,000 - $100,000+ depending on scope
- Typical project: $15,000 - $40,000
- Payment terms: 50% upfront, 50% on completion (or milestone-based for larger projects)

**Technologies:**
- React for modern web applications
- Supabase for databases and backend
- n8n for process automation
- GoHighLevel integration when applicable
- Mobile-responsive design
- API integrations with existing systems

**Example Project - Guitar Teacher Command Center:**
$23,000 custom application for music school management:
- Student enrollment and scheduling
- Teacher assignment and availability
- Automated billing and payment processing
- Parent communication portal
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Integration with existing payment processor

**When You Need Custom Software:**
- Off-the-shelf solutions don't fit your specific process
- You're using spreadsheets or manual systems that need upgrading
- You have a unique business model requiring specialized tools
- You want to productize your service for scalability
- You need multiple systems unified into one interface

**Development Process:**
1. Discovery session (2-3 hours) to understand requirements
2. Proposal with scope, timeline, and cost
3. Design mockups for approval
4. Iterative development with progress check-ins
5. Testing and refinement
6. Training and handoff
7. 30-day support period included

**Dereck's Background:**
Owned and operated a successful music school for 8 years, so he understands business operations from an owner's perspective - not just a developer's perspective.

### 5. Lead Conversion Systems

**What It Is:**
End-to-end system to capture, qualify, nurture, and convert leads automatically.

**Pricing:**
- Setup: $3,000 - $7,000
- Performance model option: Setup fee + percentage of closed deals
- Retainer model option: Monthly fee for ongoing optimization

**Components:**
1. **Capture:** Multi-channel lead intake (web forms, phone, SMS, social media)
2. **Qualification:** AI-powered questions to identify serious buyers
3. **Routing:** Smart assignment to right sales rep based on criteria
4. **Engagement:** Multi-touch follow-up across channels
5. **Conversion:** Appointment scheduling and sales enablement
6. **Analytics:** Track performance and optimize

**How It Works:**
Lead comes in → AI asks qualifying questions → Scores lead → Routes to appropriate rep → Sends personalized follow-up → Books appointment → Reminds prospect → Feeds data to CRM → Tracks conversion

**Ideal For:**
- High lead volume businesses struggling to follow up
- Sales teams missing opportunities due to slow response
- Companies with multiple lead sources needing centralization
- Businesses wanting to scale sales without adding headcount

**ROI Expectations:**
If you currently convert 5% of leads and we improve that to 8% through faster response and better qualification, that's a 60% increase in sales. On 1,000 leads per month with $5,000 average value, that's an extra $150,000 per month in revenue.

## Common Questions & Objections

### "How much does this cost?"

The honest answer is: it depends on what you need. Here are our general ranges:

- **AI Assistant:** $297/month subscription
- **Database Reactivation:** $2,500-$5,000 setup + $1/qualified lead
- **Workflow Automation:** $2,000-$40,000 project-based
- **Custom Software:** $5,000-$100,000+ depending on scope
- **Lead Conversion:** $3,000-$7,000 setup

The best way to get accurate pricing is to have a brief discovery call with Dereck where he can understand your specific situation and provide a tailored proposal.

### "How long does implementation take?"

Timelines vary by service:

- **AI Assistant:** 1-2 weeks for setup and initial training
- **Database Reactivation:** 1-2 weeks for setup, then ongoing campaigns
- **Workflow Automation:** 2-6 weeks depending on complexity
- **Custom Software:** 4-16 weeks depending on scope
- **Lead Conversion:** 2-4 weeks for full system implementation

We prioritize getting you ROI quickly, so we often implement in phases - quick wins first, then more sophisticated features.

### "What if it doesn't work for my business?"

We're selective about who we work with because we only want to take on projects where we're confident we can deliver ROI. During the discovery call, Dereck will be honest with you about whether he thinks there's a good fit.

For ongoing services like AI assistants, we don't lock you into long-term contracts. If it's not working after 90 days, you can cancel.

For project-based work, we do milestone payments so you can see progress before full payment.

### "I tried automation before and it didn't work"

This is common, and usually happens for one of these reasons:

1. **One-size-fits-all solution:** Generic tools that don't adapt to your specific process
2. **Set it and forget it:** No ongoing optimization or support
3. **Poor integration:** Doesn't connect properly with your existing systems
4. **Not business-focused:** Built by developers who don't understand business operations

Our approach is different:
- Custom solutions designed for YOUR process
- Ongoing optimization and support
- Deep integration with your existing systems
- Led by Dereck, who owned a business for 8 years and understands operations

### "Is AI going to replace my team?"

No, and that's not our philosophy. Automation should enhance what your team does, not replace the relationships that make your business special.

We focus on automating:
- Repetitive tasks (appointment reminders, data entry)
- Initial qualification (so your team talks to serious buyers)
- Follow-up sequences (so no lead falls through cracks)
- Information gathering (so calls are more productive)

This frees your team to focus on:
- Building relationships with high-value clients
- Complex problem-solving
- Strategic conversations
- Closing deals

Think of it as giving your team superpowers, not replacing them.

### "I'm not very technical - will this be complicated?"

Not at all. We handle all the technical complexity behind the scenes. From your perspective:

- **AI Assistant:** You talk to it like a person. Your team gets a simple dashboard to monitor conversations.
- **Workflow Automation:** It just works automatically. You see the results (saved time, fewer errors) without thinking about the mechanism.
- **Custom Software:** We design interfaces to be intuitive. If you can use a smartphone, you can use what we build.

We also provide training and documentation, plus ongoing support when you need help.

### "Do you work with businesses in [specific industry]?"

Our proven industries include music schools, roofing, financial services, marketing agencies, real estate, and home services.

That said, the principles of automation apply across industries. If you have:
- Repetitive tasks eating up time
- Lead follow-up challenges
- Multi-system inefficiencies
- Growth being limited by operational capacity

Then we can probably help, regardless of industry. The discovery call will help determine fit.

### "What makes you different from [competitor]?"

A few key differences:

1. **Business owner perspective:** Dereck owned a business for 8 years. He thinks about ROI and operations, not just code.

2. **Outcome-focused:** We don't sell you tools and features. We sell you outcomes (saved time, more revenue, less stress).

3. **Quality over volume:** We work with 5-10 clients at a time, not hundreds. You get attention and custom solutions.

4. **Strategic partnership approach:** We often structure deals with ongoing relationships and performance incentives. We succeed when you succeed.

5. **Honest assessment:** We'll tell you if we're not the right fit. We only take projects where we're confident in delivering value.

### "Can you guarantee results?"

We don't make guarantees about specific revenue numbers because there are variables outside our control (your offer, market conditions, sales team, etc.).

What we CAN commit to:
- **Time savings:** Automation will reduce manual work (we can measure hours saved)
- **Error reduction:** Automated processes will have fewer mistakes than manual processes
- **Response speed:** AI assistants respond instantly vs. humans who might miss calls
- **Follow-up consistency:** Automated sequences run every time, unlike humans who forget

For database reactivation, we use performance pricing ($1/qualified lead) so you only pay for results.

For custom projects, we use milestone payments so you see progress before full payment.

And we'll show you examples of our work and client results during the discovery call.
