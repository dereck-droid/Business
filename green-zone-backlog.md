## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DO NOT TOUCH UNTIL GREEN ZONE

**Current Zone:** 🔴 RED ZONE (Survival mode)

**When Can You Work On These?**
Only when you reach 🟢 GREEN ZONE:
- 8+ weeks runway
- $6,000+ cushion after bills
- MRR covering 80%+ of expenses
- Consistent revenue flow

**Why This File Exists:**
Your ENFP + Wonder brain will generate amazing ideas constantly. That's a STRENGTH, not a weakness. But acting on every idea during RED/YELLOW ZONE = scatter and failure.

**This file captures those ideas so:**
- Wonder is satisfied (idea documented, not lost)
- Discernment can evaluate (is this actually important?)
- Tenacity isn't overwhelmed (focus on ONE thing at a time)
- You can revisit when timing is right
