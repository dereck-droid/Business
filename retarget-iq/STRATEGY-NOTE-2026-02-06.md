## Recommended Action: 20-Minute Working Session

### Meeting Agenda

**Item 1 - Knowledge Base Review (5 min)**
- Delegate to Cindy or support team member (not Nate)
- Ask for 30-min scan of Google Doc flagging only errors
- Set specific deadline for completion
- Scope: "If it looks right, skip it. Only flag what's wrong."

**Item 2 - Conflicting Help Center Data (5 min)**
- Show side-by-side: our KB vs acquiring company's help center
- Recommendation: Use our KB as base (sourced from real communications), supplement gaps from help center
- Get yes/no on the spot

**Item 3 - Proposal Trigger Decision (5 min)**
- Option 1: Send after every successful meeting (simplest)
- Option 2: Sales rep verbally promises proposal on call, AI detects it (RECOMMENDED)
- Option 3: AI reads between the lines on every call (least reliable)
- Get decision on the spot

### Suggested WhatsApp Message

> Hey Nate - I know you guys are absolutely slammed right now (congrats on the growth btw). I've been intentionally keeping things off your plate and I'm 90% there on everything. I just need 15-20 min to run through three quick decisions with you so I can finish and get these systems live. Could we do a quick call [date]? I'll have everything prepped so we can knock it out fast.

## Strategic Context

- Lead Supercharger partnership (25% equity, $4-8K/mo potential) depends on strong delivery
- Their growth surge = more need for automation, not less
- Every day of delay = another day team manually handles what automation should cover
- Getting systems live during growth period = strongest possible proof of value
