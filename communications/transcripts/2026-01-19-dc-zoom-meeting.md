- Download videos + transcriptions
- Extract script structures and templates
- Problem: Manual process, time-consuming

**2. Meeting Notes Chaos**
- Uses Fathom for meeting recordings

- Track all client interactions in one place

**3. Sales Pipeline Needs**
- Doesn't have a CRM (uses Airtable)
- Needs to move to GoHighLevel
- Wants simple, not complex
- Done-for-you, not done-with-you

**4. Lead Gen Campaign Coming**
- Big contracts ending April
- Needs lead gen for his agency
- Will need sales calls → needs pipeline ready
- Timeline: Next 2-3 months

### DC's Business Context

**Agency Model:**
- Lead gen for clients

- High retention, relationship-based
- Does sales calls himself (wants to be on relationship)

**Current Status:**

2. Meeting automation (Fathom → GHL)
   - Auto-summarize calls
   - Extract data to CRM
   - Track by client

**Future (Not Now):**

## Relationship Building

### Personal Connection
- Friends from N8N Facebook groups

- Offered free coaching (relationship-first approach)
- Empathized with Dereck's partnership betrayal

### Trust Level
- HIGH (offered free coaching, vulnerable conversation)
- Warm lead, not cold
- Friend, not just prospect

## Technical Discussions

### Software Development Complexity
- DC asked about building apps (Gemini, Supabase, Vercel)
- Dereck explained BMAD method, user stories, complexity
- Discussion on "the last 20%" being hardest
- DC realized: "I just want simple apps to replace Google Docs"

**Outcome:** DC not ready to learn software development, wants done-for-you services

### GoHighLevel Advice
**Dereck's Recommendation:**
- Start with 3 core features (messaging, pipeline, websites)
- Ignore everything else until those are mastered
- Don't get overwhelmed by all the features
- GHL is a "Swiss army knife" - easy to get lost

**DC's Response:** Appreciated the advice
