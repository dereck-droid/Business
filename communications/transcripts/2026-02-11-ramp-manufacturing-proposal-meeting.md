## Meeting Summary

## Key Discussion Points

### Proof of Concept Scope (Saj's question)
- Saj asked whether the POC would use one of their actual products or be a generic demo
- Dereck clarified: bare bones, demonstrates basic functionality -- shows "this clearly works"
- Offered a "Phase 0.5" option if they wanted deeper validation of logic transfer before committing to Phase 1

### AI Model Selection (Saj's question)
- Saj asked how Dereck decides which AI provider to use
- Dereck explained: different models have different strengths (language, research, visual generation)
- Recommends OpenRouter for enterprise access to all major providers through one channel
- Various models will be used for different parts of the process

### Monthly Recurring Costs (Saj's question)
- Saj calculated ~$900/mo from the licensing estimates in the proposal
- Dereck clarified: AI API costs ($200-500/mo) depend heavily on usage volume (how many products they're running through the system)
- Hosting and storage costs are more predictable
- Phase 0 will deliver precise figures

### No Questions from Dave
- Dave was present but had no questions
