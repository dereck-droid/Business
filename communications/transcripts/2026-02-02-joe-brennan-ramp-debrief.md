## Performance Review (How Did Dereck Do?)

### Joe's Assessment: Standing Ovation

**Joe's exact words:**
> "Brother, standing ovation."

**What Worked:**
- Handled pressure well (especially from Joe K)
- Honest about unknowns: "There's a lot I don't see yet, I'll discover through the process"
- Good positioning on domain knowledge gap
- Let Joe B rescue the proposal structure conversation

**Dereck's Self-Assessment:**
> "I felt under pressure a little bit, especially from brother Joe [Kreidler]."

**Joe B's Strategy:**
> "I always wait, I don't want to interfere. It was going really well. And I thought if I open my mouth I'll reveal that I'm just not as smart as these guys."

But intervened perfectly at the end to get Joe K to define proposal expectations.

## Critical Business Intelligence

### RAMP's Current State

**Joe's Assessment:**
> "They're absolute startups."

**What This Means:**
- ❌ **No capacity bottleneck** (not desperate for solution to scale)
- ✅ **Seeking competitive advantage** (thinking ahead, strategic)
- ✅ **Speed and precision matter** (competitive differentiation)
- ⚠️ **Budget-conscious** (startup mindset, not enterprise spending)

**Funding:**
- Self-funded (not VC-backed)
- Left Deloitte to start RAMP
- "Blues Brothers" reunion - getting the band back together
- "Let's do this again, one more time in a different way and make some more money"

**Motivation:**
> "You can make more money per unit than you can selling your hours."

Shift from hourly consulting (Deloitte) to manufacturing (per-unit economics).

### The Team ("All-Stars")

**Joe's Description:**
> "Those are all-stars... really, really experienced in product development."

**Their Background:**
- All Joe's age (senior, 20+ years experience)
- Left Deloitte together
- Previously at Optimal Design
- Deep manufacturing expertise
- Well-networked in industry

### Network Value (Major Upside)

**Joe's Intel:**
> "If we succeed, they're so well networked with other manufacturers. Think of being a top-notch product development firm that then has to hand it off."

**The Opportunity Chain:**
1. RAMP does product development
2. Partners with larger manufacturers for scale production
3. If we solve this for RAMP, introductions to larger manufacturers
4. Could scale across manufacturing vertical

**Joe's Framing:**
> "That's where we could come in on a larger scale and be introduced to some really cool entities."

## Industry Context (Product Development)

### Typical Contract Structure

**Average Product Development Project:**
- **$75,000** from idea to manufacturing-ready
- Broken into phases with deliverables
- Re-quote between phases
- "Objective with every phase and a deliverable"

**Profitability:**
- They accept **20% gross profit margin**
- Not great margins, but acceptable
- Higher margins when they manufacture units (their shift strategy)

### Phase Zero (Industry Standard)

**Joe's Explanation:**
> "Between the two of us, we've written who knows how many proposals in their language in this industry. What you're referring to is a phase zero."

**Phase Zero Definition:**
- Come together, start this out
- Move from phase to phase
- Re-quote, re-imagine, re-jigger from that point forward

**Why This Matters:**
- Dereck's instinct to quote "just as far as I know" was **perfectly correct**
- This is their expected approach
- They're comfortable with unknowns and iterative refinement

**Joe's Validation:**
> "You were perfectly consistent when you answered the question and said 'just as far as I know.' That's all you can bid."

## Pricing Strategy Discussion

### The Challenge: Not Knowing How to Price

**Dereck's Questions:**
- What revenue does RAMP do currently?
- What's average revenue per project?
- Are they at capacity? (Answered: No, they're startups)
- What do they have to gain?
- What do they have to lose?
- Where could we take them vs. where will they be without us?

**The Value Equation:**
> "Where could we take you versus where will you be without us? And what is that worth to you?"

### Measurable Improvement (The Anchor)

**Joe's Insight:**
> "In all of those disciplines that he discussed, they all have price per hour. So there's a measurable improvement. That's probably the only one we can hang our hat on that I can think of that's rock solid."

**Translation:**
- Engineers cost $X per hour (fully loaded)
- 2-6 weeks = 80-240 hours per project
- At $80-150/hour = $6,400-$36,000 per project in labor
- 10-20 projects/year = $64K-$720K annually in engineer time
- **This is the ROI justification**

### Joe's Pricing Model

**His Current Approach:**
- **$100/hour**
- **40-hour retainer** upfront
- Work through over 2-4 weeks
- "I don't know if you've worked out how you value your hours"

**Advice:**
> "Figure out the amount of hours it takes for you to do this and get well paid for it. Maybe divide by 0.7 so you cover my 30%."

**Strategic Note:**
> "Maybe the money to be had starts after we figure out exactly what we have here."

Translation: Discovery might be modest, but implementation is where real revenue lives.

## Partnership Structure Discussion

### Joe's Role & Contributions

**What Joe Brings:**
1. **Terminology translation**
   > "I'm going to limit the number of phone calls you'll have to make to them to clarify."

2. **Proposal templates**
   > "I've got untold templates on this crap."

3. **Industry formatting**
   - Knows their expected proposal structure
   - Can format in manufacturing language
   - Reduces friction with client

4. **Time value to client**
   > "These guys are all, you know, time is money."

**Jim Mention:**
> "I bet between you and Jim and I, we could take what you've got, format it how they appreciate."

Dereck: "Forgot about him. Heck yeah, dude."

### Compensation Discussion (Implicit)

**Joe's Framework:**
- He charges $100/hour normally
- 40-hour retainers standard
- Mentioned "divide by 0.7 to cover my 30%"
- Acknowledges his 30% cut in pricing math

**Action Item Created:**
> "Email Joe Phase 0 discovery proposal (scope, hours, pricing, team, deliverables) by Feb 4"

**Dereck's Timeline:**
- Wednesday (Feb 4): Send to Joe for review
- Friday (Feb 6): Joe and Dereck finalize and send to RAMP

## Dereck's Self-Awareness Moment

### The Growth Edge

**Dereck's Reflection:**
> "That one's tough for me. I've had to learn so much about myself in order to be like, 'You don't talk too much and you try to qualify yourself by displaying competence.' Sometimes you just got to say, 'Yeah, I can't tell you that because I don't know yet.'"

**Joe's Validation:**
> "That was good. You stretched right there."

**The Lesson:**
> "What always sells is honesty. That's what they call transparency. It's how I operate. And I think they do as well."

## Pricing Strategy Brainstorm

### Discovery Phase Pricing

**Considerations:**
1. They're startups (not flush with cash)
2. Looking for competitive advantage (strategic value)
3. Joe gets 30% (need to price accordingly)
4. Measurable ROI exists (engineer hour savings)
5. This could open network to other manufacturers

**Dereck's Approach:**
> "I tend to price things as packages. Price is determined by what the value is to them."

**Examples:**
- Company with no budget but desperate need: "Stretch for them but they'll do it"
- Company making $100M in 36 months with solution: "Sky high comparatively"

### Context Adjustment Based on Intel

**Before Joe's intel:** Might price discovery at $8-10K (assuming capacity pain)
**After Joe's intel:** Should price $5-7K (startup, thinking ahead, no bottleneck)

**The ROI Pitch:**
- Engineers spend 2-6 weeks per project
- If we save even 50% of that time (1-3 weeks)
- 40-120 hours saved × $100-150/hour
- $4,000-$18,000 saved PER PROJECT
- Discovery investment pays back in 1-2 projects

## Strategic Insights

### Why This Could Be Big

**Barrier to Entry:**
> "This is not what all the teenagers are talking about. This is not mowing lawns. There's a barrier to entry. This is giving tools to senior citizens [metaphorically] - giving new tools."

**Network Effect:**
- RAMP well-connected with manufacturers
- Success here = introductions elsewhere
- Manufacturing vertical entry point
- "Really cool entities" Joe mentioned

**Timing:**
- They're at beginning of RAMP venture
- Building competitive advantage now
- 2026 = "AI in manufacturing becomes normal"

### Risk Factors

**Budget Sensitivity:**
- Startups are budget-conscious
- Can't price like enterprise
- Need to justify ROI clearly

**Expectations Management:**
- They're "brainiacs" (Saj especially)
- Want to understand how it works
- Not just "trust us" relationship

**Deliverable Standards:**
- They expect quality (engineering rigor)
- Phases with clear deliverables
- Can't be vague or hand-wavy
