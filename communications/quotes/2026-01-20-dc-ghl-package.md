## Quote Sent (Email)

**Subject Line:** GoHighLevel Setup & Automation Pricing

**Full Email:**

> Hey, DC!

> It was genuinely such a treat to chat with you today. It's been so long, I forgot how kind and sincere you are and we definitely need to stay in touch better moving forward!
>
> Here's what it would look like to get you set up:
>
> **GoHighLevel Subscription:**
> - Monthly: $297/month
> - Annual: $2,851/year (saves you $713)
>
> **Setup Services:**
>
> Since your needs are straightforward (sales pipeline, basic automations, meeting notes integration), here's the breakdown:
>
> **Option 1: À la carte**
>
> **GHL Setup & Configuration: $1,500**
> - Business profile setup
> - Sales pipeline structure
> - Contact & lead management setup
> - Email/SMS workflows
> - Team user setup & permissions
> - Training videos for you and your team on core functions of the platform
>
> **Fathom Meeting Automation: $1,200**
> - Summarize the meeting, capturing critical details
> - Place summarization into contact notes, and key data points into contact details
> - Update in pipeline based off of the call outcome
> - Post-call follow-up workflows based off of outcome
> - Create certain tasks for particular users based on the outcome of the call so that nothing slips through the cracks and lead nurture/conversion is fully optimized
> - **All summaries and data extraction is custom and to your liking**
>
> **Option 2: Bundle**
> - $2,500 one-time (saves you $200)
> - Includes both setups above
> - Plus: $297/month OR $2,851/year subscription
>
> **Timeline:** Should have you fully operational within 2 weeks once we kick off.
>
> **Early Decision Bonus:**
>
> If you're ready to commit this week on the complete package (setup + automation + annual subscription), I'll do the whole thing for $5,000 flat - a massive discount from the actual value - $6,264.
>
> **Why I'm offering this:**
> - I really appreciate your friendship!
> - Getting paid upfront helps me fund my ad campaigns immediately
> - I know you mentioned you guys need to iron out some sales processes, but there's a lot to set up beyond that, so I'll have plenty to work on and then we can get your pipeline and automations pretty close to perfect and iterate as needed as you guys begin taking calls and begin to define and refine the ideal sales process.
>
> No pressure at all, take the few weeks you mentioned if you need them. The pricing listed in Option 1 and 2 will hold either way.
>
> Appreciate you, brother!

## His Response

**Status:** NO RESPONSE YET (4 days)

**Expected Timeline:**
- He said in the meeting: "give me a few weeks to go over it"
- He's at capacity right now
- Big contracts ending in April (needs systems before then)
- Needs to align with team on processes

**This is normal.** Not ghosting.

---

## Meeting Context (Jan 19)

**What He Wants:**
1. GoHighLevel CRM setup (done-for-you, not done-with-you)
2. Sales pipeline mapped out
3. Fathom meeting notes automation → GHL integration
4. Landing pages for coaching business expansion
5. Simple system (he's overwhelmed, wants it "done")

**What He DOESN'T Want:**
- Complexity
- Learning curve
- To be "part of the build" right now

**His Situation:**
- Marketing agency owner (lead gen for clients)
- 3-5 year client relationships (high retention)
- Currently at capacity
- Big contracts ending April → needs lead gen campaign
- Doing more coaching now (goal setting, client management)
- Offered free coaching group through Feb (Mondays & Thursdays)

**Why He's Slow to Respond:**
- At capacity (doesn't have time to think about this now)
- Needs to get team aligned on sales processes first
- Big contracts ending April = thinking 2-3 months ahead, not urgent now

---

## Revenue Breakdown

| Option | Revenue | Timeline |
|--------|---------|----------|
| À la carte (both) | $2,700 | One-time |
| Bundle | $2,500 | One-time |
| Early Decision | $5,000 | One-time (includes annual GHL) |

**Most Likely:** Bundle ($2,500) when he's ready

---

## Days to Cash Analysis

**If he responds today:** 45-60 days to payment
- Response time: 2-4 weeks
- Decision + alignment: 1-2 weeks
- Project: 2 weeks
- Payment terms: Net 7-15

**Realistic:** 60+ days to cash

**This solves Feb 4 bills:** NO ❌ (way too slow)

---

## Strategic Value

**Why This Matters (Even Though It's Slow):**
- Relationship building (friend, warm connection)
- Coaching opportunity (he offered free group)
- Potential referrals (he's well-connected in marketing)
- Recurring relationship (agency owners need ongoing support)

**Keep Warm, Not Urgent:**
- Follow up in 2 weeks (Feb 3) with friendly nudge
- Accept coaching group offer (build relationship)
- Don't push - he told you he needs time

---

## Next Actions

1. ⏳ **Feb 3:** Send friendly check-in (it will be ~2 weeks)
2. ⏳ **Meanwhile:** Accept his coaching group offer
3. ⏳ **If he ghosts:** Follow up again in another 2 weeks

**Sample Follow-Up (Feb 3):**
> Hey DC! Hope you crushed that call you had to prep for. No rush on the GHL quote at all - I know you said you need a few weeks to think it over and get your team aligned. Just wanted to check in and see how things are going on your end.
>
> Also, don't let me forget about those coaching group links you mentioned! I'm definitely taking you up on that through Feb. Would love to lock in those goal-setting sessions.
>
> Talk soon, brother!

---

## Communication Channel
