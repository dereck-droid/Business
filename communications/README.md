- `detailed-context/` - Link to full communication threads

## Why This Matters

**Problem this solves:**
- "What did I quote them?" → Check `/quotes/`
- "When did we last talk?" → Check `/transcripts/` or `/follow-ups/`
- "What did they say exactly?" → Check the file
- AI agent needs context → All communications documented

**Prevents:**
- Stale data in tracking files
- Lost context between sessions
- Conflicting information
- Memory gaps
