## Notes for Sales Conversations

**Price Objections:**
- Don't discount immediately
- Explore: "What were you expecting?"
- Educate on value and ROI
- Show comparable alternatives (often worse and more expensive)
- If genuinely can't afford: Offer phased approach or retainer model

**Budget Qualification:**
- Ask early: "What budget range are you working with?"
- For enterprise: "Have you allocated budget for this initiative?"
- Avoid: Spending time on proposals for clients who can't afford solutions

**Value Anchoring:**
- Lead with outcome: "How much is 20 hours/week worth to you?"
- Show ROI: "If this generated 10 extra deals/year at $5K each, what's that worth?"
- Compare to alternatives: "Hiring someone full-time would be $50K+/year"

**Closing:**
- Make it easy: "Let's start with a pilot/MVP"
- Create urgency: "I have limited capacity"
- Remove risk: "30-day money-back guarantee" or "Milestone-based payments"

This pricing structure will evolve as business stabilizes and SaaS products launch. Current focus: Close deals for cash flow while building foundation for recurring revenue.
