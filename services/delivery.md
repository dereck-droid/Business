## Development Methodology

### BMAD Method (Business Model Analysis and Design)

**What It Is:**
- Systematic approach to designing business solutions
- AI-assisted development process
- Focus on business outcomes, not just technical features
- Iterative refinement based on real-world testing

**How It Works:**
1. **Business Model Analysis**
   - Understand current state and pain points
   - Identify leverage points for automation
   - Map desired outcomes and success metrics

2. **Solution Design**
   - Design approach with AI assistance
   - Create technical architecture
   - Plan MVP and iteration roadmap

3. **Development with AI**
   - Use Claude Code for implementation
   - Non-developer leveraging AI strategically
   - Rapid prototyping and testing

4. **Validation & Refinement**
   - Test with real users/data
   - Measure accuracy and outcomes
   - Iterate based on feedback

**Key Advantage:**
- Non-developer can build complex solutions
- Faster time to MVP
- Focus stays on business value, not technical complexity

- Timely feedback on iterations
- Team availability for training
- Trust in expertise while staying involved

**What Works Best:**
- Collaborative, not dictatorial
- Open to recommendations
- Willing to test and iterate
- Invested in success

**Red Flags:**
- Micromanaging technical decisions without expertise
- Constantly changing requirements without adjustment to scope/timeline
- Unavailable for feedback and testing
- Unrealistic timeline expectations

---

## Communication Approach

### With Clients

**Focus on Outcomes:**
- Emphasize business growth opportunities
- Highlight time savings and efficiency gains
- Show ROI and measurable impact
- Minimize technical jargon unless client is technical

**Example Communications:**
- ❌ "We'll use n8n to create a webhook that triggers an API call..."
- ✅ "When a lead submits a form, the system will automatically qualify them and book an appointment with your team within minutes"

- ❌ "The database schema needs normalization and we'll implement RLS policies..."
- ✅ "Each church's data will be completely private and secure, even though they're on the same platform"

**Regular Updates:**
- Weekly check-ins during development
- Milestone completion notifications
- Issues addressed promptly and transparently
- Celebrate wins and progress

---

### Communication Channels

**Primary:**
- Email for async updates
- Scheduled video calls for discovery and check-ins
- WhatsApp/text for existing relationships (Retarget IQ)

**Project Management:**
- [TO BE DETERMINED - May use notion, clickup, or other PM tool]
- Currently: Email + scheduled calls

**Support:**
- Email for support requests
- Response time based on retainer level
- Emergency channel for critical issues (if applicable)

---

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Approach

**Accuracy Validation:**
- Test with real data whenever possible
- Example: GFCU compliance automation - 100% accuracy before presenting
- Define success metrics upfront
- Exceed expectations on core functionality

**Edge Case Testing:**
- Identify potential failure points
- Test with unusual inputs
- Handle errors gracefully
- Fail-safes and notifications

**Performance Testing:**
- Validate under expected load
- Optimize for speed where it matters
- Monitor resource usage
- Scalability considerations

**User Experience Testing:**
- Test with actual end users when possible
- Simplicity and clarity
- Mobile responsiveness (when applicable)
- Accessibility considerations

---

### Success Metrics

**Define Upfront:**
- What does success look like?
- How will we measure it?
- What's the baseline vs. target?

**Examples:**
- **Database Reactivation:** Qualified leads generated, appointments booked, conversion rate
- **Compliance Automation:** Accuracy percentage, time saved, errors prevented
- **Lead Conversion:** Conversion rate improvement, time to contact, appointments booked
- **Custom Software:** User adoption rate, time saved, specific feature usage

**Regular Reporting:**
- Monthly performance summaries (if on retainer)
- Quarterly business reviews
- Recommendations for optimization

---

## Support Structure

### Included Support (Post-Launch)

**Standard (30-90 days post-launch):**
- Bug fixes and issues
- Technical troubleshooting
- Minor adjustments to functionality
- Training reinforcement

**Not Included:**
- New features or scope expansion
- Significant redesigns
- Third-party system changes requiring rework
- Ongoing optimization (unless on retainer)

---

### Ongoing Support Options

**Retainer Model:**
- Bronze: $500/month (5 hours)
- Silver: $1,500/month (15 hours)
- Gold: $3,000/month (30 hours)

**Includes:**
- Ongoing optimization
- New workflow additions
- Integration updates
- Priority support
- Proactive monitoring

**Ad-Hoc Support:**
- $150/hour
- Minimum 2-hour blocks

- No commitment required

---

## Partnership Delivery Model

### Lead Supercharger Example

**Dereck's Responsibilities:**
- Technical development (initial build)
- System architecture and design
- Integration with Retarget IQ data API
- Ongoing maintenance and updates

**Partner's Responsibilities (Retarget IQ):**
- Customer acquisition and sales
- Marketing and advertising
- All upfront capital investment
- Data API access at $0 cost
- Customer support (or shared)

**Why This Model Works:**
- Plays to each party's strengths
- Dereck: Focus on Wonder/Discernment (design), delegate Tenacity (customer acquisition, delivery)
- Partners: Leverage existing distribution (10-15 appts/day)
- Aligned incentives (equity/revenue share)
- Scalable without linear time investment from Dereck

---

## Delivery Constraints & Considerations

### Current Capacity

**Dereck's Time Allocation:**
- Limited bandwidth as solo operator
- Must balance:
  - Existing client work (Ken's $23K project)
  - New prospect meetings (Ben, L2T, 365, DC)
  - Strategic opportunities (Lead Supercharger research)
  - Business operations (this repository, financial management)

**Implication for New Projects:**
- Clear prioritization required
- Phased delivery timelines
- Can't take on unlimited simultaneous projects
- Partnership models preferred for scalability

---

### Financial Zone Impact on Delivery

**RED ZONE (Current):**
- Priority: Close deals quickly
- Delivery: Can't start new long-term builds
- Exception: Lead Supercharger (strategic, recurring potential)
- Focus: Complete existing work, close quick wins

**YELLOW ZONE (4-8 weeks runway):**
- Can take on medium-complexity projects
- Balance quick wins with strategic builds
- 2-4 week delivery timelines manageable

**GREEN ZONE (8+ weeks runway):**
- Can invest in longer-term SaaS builds
- Prayer Board completion (60-90 days)
- Elimination Diet app development (4-6 months)
- More experimental projects

---

## Tools & Systems for Delivery

### Project Management
**Current:** Email + scheduled calls
**Future:** May implement ClickUp, Notion, or similar
**Client Portal:** Under consideration for professional delivery experience

### Time Tracking
**Current:** Not formally tracking (project-based pricing)
**Future:** May implement for retainer clients

### Documentation
**Approach:** Living documentation updated throughout project
**Format:** Markdown files, video tutorials, written guides
**Storage:** GitHub, Google Drive, or client's preferred platform

### Version Control
**Code Projects:** Git/GitHub
**Workflow Automation:** Export and backup configurations
**Database:** Migration files and backups

---

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### What Works

✅ **Clear Discovery:** Invest time upfront to truly understand needs
✅ **MVP Approach:** Don't overbuild, validate core value first
✅ **Regular Communication:** Weekly check-ins prevent surprises
✅ **Test Early & Often:** GFCU 100% accuracy before presenting
✅ **Focus on Outcomes:** Business growth + time savings resonate

### What to Avoid

❌ **Scope Creep:** Clear boundaries, charge for additions
❌ **Overpromising:** Under-promise, over-deliver
❌ **Skipping Testing:** Always validate accuracy before launch
❌ **Poor Budget Qualification:** GFCU lesson - discuss budget upfront
❌ **Taking Bad-Fit Clients:** Values misalignment creates problems

## Future Delivery Evolution

### Current State (Solo + AI)
- Dereck + Claude Code
- Limited simultaneous capacity
- Project-based delivery
- Some recurring support (Ken)

### Near-Term (6-12 Months)
- Partnership models (Lead Supercharger)
- Possibly hire for Tenacity tasks (execution support)
- More systemized delivery (templates, processes)
- Retainer clients for recurring revenue

### Long-Term (1-3 Years)
- Team support for delivery (Dereck focuses on strategy)
- SaaS products (automated delivery)
- High-value consulting only (implementation delegated)
- Partnership equity models (distribute delivery responsibility)
- Dereck stays in Wonder + Discernment Genius zone
