## 💡 DECISION-MAKING CONTEXT

**Your Personality (ENFP + Wonder/Discernment):**
- ✅ **Strengths:** Visionary, relationship builder, pattern recognition
- ⚠️ **Watch Out For:** Too many ideas, shiny object syndrome, struggle to complete
- 🎯 **Stay In Genius:** Spend 70%+ time on Wonder (exploring opportunities) + Discernment (evaluating fit)
- 🚫 **Avoid Tenacity Traps:** Use systems/AI for execution, not your time

**Current Zone:** 🟢 GREEN (8 weeks runway!) 🎉

**Updated Priority Formula (GREEN ZONE):**
- **Strategic Value: 50%** - Recurring revenue, partnerships, scalability potential
  - 10/10 = Recurring MRR or equity partnerships
  - 7/10 = High-value ongoing relationships
  - 4/10 = One-time projects with referral potential
  - 1/10 = One-off, no strategic value
- **Deal Amount: 20%** - How much revenue?
- **Close Probability: 15%** - How likely to close?
- **Days to Cash: 10%** - Less urgent now (you have runway!)
- **Execution Demand: 5%** - How much work?

**What This Means:**
- Focus on STRATEGIC opportunities (recurring revenue, partnerships)
- Lead Supercharger = TOP PRIORITY ($4-8K/mo recurring = MRR multiplier)
- Ben = HIGH PRIORITY (potential ongoing, $5-20K+ value)
- Retarget IQ project = deliver well (already paid, relationship builder)
- Prayer Board, Elimination Diet = NOW VIABLE (you have runway to build)
- Take your time, choose strategic wins over quick cash

## 🎯 FOCUS AGENT QUESTIONS (Daily Check-In)

**When this is automated, you'll answer these each morning:**

1. What's total cash across all accounts today?

4. Any meetings scheduled or completed?
5. What feels most urgent to your Discernment today?

**Agent will then:**
- Update financial snapshot and runway
- Recalculate priority scores
- Output your top 3 actions for the day
- Commit changes to this file

## 📝 NOTES & INSIGHTS

**Key Learnings (This Week):**
- Lead Supercharger research complete: V1 = GHL only (2-3 weeks), expand based on demand
- "Build to sell" strategy = minimize operational complexity, not engineering complexity
- HubSpot not as turnkey as assumed (requires Operations Hub, manual workflow setup)
- Native integrations > Zapier/webhook-only approaches for exit value
- Kin declined 12-month prepay - focus on other opportunities

**Previous Insights:**
- Retarget IQ has 10-15 appointments/day (massive lead flow)
- Partnership potential could be bigger than just Lead Supercharger
- Ben's senior team meeting next week = significant opportunity
- Your best close rate is with warm leads (Retarget IQ, Ben vs. cold pool builders)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Don't chase shiny objects (Wonder activation) - V1 GHL only, resist urge to build all platforms
- Trust your Discernment on deal quality - 25% equity feels fair
- Use systems to overcome Tenacity struggles
- Close quick wins before building long-term projects

## 💡 Dynamic Task Backlog

**Have an idea or see changing conditions?** Check the dynamic backlog.

👉 **[View Full Backlog](./backlog.md)** - All tasks with urgency, importance, and conditions

### Tasks Viable in Your Current Zone (🔴 RED)

**Currently Urgent & Red-Zone-OK:**
1. Lead Supercharger research (Urgency: 10/10) - TONIGHT
2. Close deals: Ben, Kin, L2T, 365 (Urgency: 9/10) - THIS WEEK
3. Complete Ken's project (Urgency: 8/10) - ONGOING

**Waiting for Better Zone:**
- Prayer Board completion → Yellow Zone (UNLESS church contacts ready to pay)
- Ad Checker completion → Yellow Zone (UNLESS customer ready to pay)
- Claude Code mastery → Green Zone (UNLESS major contract requires it)
- Hire VA support → Green Zone + $8K MRR

**Why this matters:**
Your Wonder (genius) generates infinite ideas - that's a STRENGTH! The backlog captures them with **dynamic conditions** that determine when they become urgent.

**The backlog adapts:**
- Church calls about Prayer Board? → Urgency jumps from 4/10 to 10/10 (work on it NOW)
- Land big contract needing skills? → Learning jumps from 3/10 to 9/10 (prioritize NOW)
- Reach Yellow Zone? → Multiple tasks become viable
- Conditions change? → Priorities adjust automatically

**Check it when:**
- ✅ You have a new idea (add it with conditions)
- ✅ Something changes (church interest, contract landed, zone shift)
- ✅ Weekly review (update urgency based on current reality)

**Stay focused NOW, but know when to pivot if conditions warrant it.**
