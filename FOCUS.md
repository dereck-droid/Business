## 💡 DECISION-MAKING CONTEXT

**Your Personality (ENFP + Wonder/Discernment):**
- ✅ **Strengths:** Visionary, relationship builder, pattern recognition
- ⚠️ **Watch Out For:** Too many ideas, shiny object syndrome, struggle to complete
- 🎯 **Stay In Genius:** Spend 70%+ time on Wonder (exploring opportunities) + Discernment (evaluating fit)
- 🚫 **Avoid Tenacity Traps:** Use systems/AI for execution, not your time

**Current Zone:** 🔴 RED (Revenue Urgency = 50% of priority weight)

**What This Means:**
- Focus on CLOSING deals, not building new things
- Exception: Lead Supercharger research (2-3 hours) because it's strategic
- Prayer Board, Elimination Diet, Ad Checker = wait until Green Zone

---

## 🎯 FOCUS AGENT QUESTIONS (Daily Check-In)

**When this is automated, you'll answer these each morning:**

1. What's total cash across all accounts today?
2. Any bills paid yesterday or revenue received?
3. Any prospect updates? (Retarget IQ, Ben, Kin, L2T, 365, DC)
4. Any meetings scheduled or completed?
5. What feels most urgent to your Discernment today?

**Agent will then:**
- Update financial snapshot and runway
- Recalculate priority scores
- Output your top 3 actions for the day
- Commit changes to this file

## 📝 NOTES & INSIGHTS

**Key Learnings:**
- Retarget IQ has 10-15 appointments/day (massive lead flow)
- If they refer even 2-3 clients/month at $3-5K = $6-15K/month pipeline
- Partnership potential could be bigger than just Lead Supercharger
- Ben's senior team meeting next week = significant opportunity
- Your best close rate is with warm leads (Retarget IQ, Ben, Kin vs. cold pool builders)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Don't chase shiny objects (Wonder activation)
- Trust your Discernment on deal quality
- Use systems to overcome Tenacity struggles
- Close quick wins before building long-term projects

---

**Remember:** You thrive in structure and systems. This FOCUS dashboard IS the structure. Check it daily. Update it. Let it guide you away from scatter and toward stability.

## 💡 Great Ideas for Later

**Have an idea that's not urgent?** Don't lose it, but don't act on it yet.

👉 **Add it to [Green Zone Backlog](./green-zone-backlog.md)**

This file captures:
- Learning goals (Claude Code mastery, workflow improvements)
- Product completions (Prayer Board, Ad Checker, Elimination Diet)
- Strategic initiatives (referral network, hiring support)
- Infrastructure upgrades (Focus Agent, bank integrations)

**Why this matters:**
Your Wonder (genius) will generate infinite ideas. That's a STRENGTH, not a weakness. But acting on every idea during RED/YELLOW ZONE = scatter and failure.

**The backlog satisfies Wonder (idea captured) without derailing Tenacity (execution focus).**

🔴 **While in RED ZONE:** Don't touch the backlog. Stay focused on FOCUS.md priorities.

🟢 **When you reach GREEN ZONE:** Pick ONE item from backlog to pursue.
