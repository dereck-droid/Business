## 💡 DECISION-MAKING CONTEXT

**Your Personality (ENFP + Wonder/Discernment):**
- ✅ **Strengths:** Visionary, relationship builder, pattern recognition
- ⚠️ **Watch Out For:** Too many ideas, shiny object syndrome, struggle to complete
- 🎯 **Stay In Genius:** Spend 70%+ time on Wonder (exploring opportunities) + Discernment (evaluating fit)
- 🚫 **Avoid Tenacity Traps:** Use systems/AI for execution, not your time

**Current Zone:** 🔴 RED (Revenue Urgency = 50% of priority weight)

**What This Means:**
- Focus on CLOSING deals, not building new things
- Exception: Lead Supercharger research (2-3 hours) because it's strategic
- Prayer Board, Elimination Diet, Ad Checker = wait until Green Zone

---

## 🎯 FOCUS AGENT QUESTIONS (Daily Check-In)

**When this is automated, you'll answer these each morning:**

1. What's total cash across all accounts today?
2. Any bills paid yesterday or revenue received?
3. Any prospect updates? (Retarget IQ, Ben, Kin, L2T, 365, DC)
4. Any meetings scheduled or completed?
5. What feels most urgent to your Discernment today?

**Agent will then:**
- Update financial snapshot and runway
- Recalculate priority scores
- Output your top 3 actions for the day
- Commit changes to this file

## 📝 NOTES & INSIGHTS

**Key Learnings (This Week):**
- Lead Supercharger research complete: V1 = GHL only (2-3 weeks), expand based on demand
- "Build to sell" strategy = minimize operational complexity, not engineering complexity
- HubSpot not as turnkey as assumed (requires Operations Hub, manual workflow setup)
- Native integrations > Zapier/webhook-only approaches for exit value
- Kin declined 12-month prepay - focus on other opportunities

**Previous Insights:**
- Retarget IQ has 10-15 appointments/day (massive lead flow)
- Partnership potential could be bigger than just Lead Supercharger
- Ben's senior team meeting next week = significant opportunity
- Your best close rate is with warm leads (Retarget IQ, Ben vs. cold pool builders)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Don't chase shiny objects (Wonder activation) - V1 GHL only, resist urge to build all platforms
- Trust your Discernment on deal quality - 25% equity feels fair
- Use systems to overcome Tenacity struggles
- Close quick wins before building long-term projects

**Remember:** You thrive in structure and systems. This FOCUS dashboard IS the structure. Check it daily. Update it. Let it guide you away from scatter and toward stability.

## 💡 Dynamic Task Backlog

**Have an idea or see changing conditions?** Check the dynamic backlog.

👉 **[View Full Backlog](./backlog.md)** - All tasks with urgency, importance, and conditions

### Tasks Viable in Your Current Zone (🔴 RED)

**Currently Urgent & Red-Zone-OK:**
1. Lead Supercharger research (Urgency: 10/10) - TONIGHT
2. Close deals: Ben, Kin, L2T, 365 (Urgency: 9/10) - THIS WEEK
3. Complete Ken's project (Urgency: 8/10) - ONGOING

**Waiting for Better Zone:**
- Prayer Board completion → Yellow Zone (UNLESS church contacts ready to pay)
- Ad Checker completion → Yellow Zone (UNLESS customer ready to pay)
- Claude Code mastery → Green Zone (UNLESS major contract requires it)
- Hire VA support → Green Zone + $8K MRR

**Why this matters:**
Your Wonder (genius) generates infinite ideas - that's a STRENGTH! The backlog captures them with **dynamic conditions** that determine when they become urgent.

**The backlog adapts:**
- Church calls about Prayer Board? → Urgency jumps from 4/10 to 10/10 (work on it NOW)
- Land big contract needing skills? → Learning jumps from 3/10 to 9/10 (prioritize NOW)
- Reach Yellow Zone? → Multiple tasks become viable
- Conditions change? → Priorities adjust automatically

**Check it when:**
- ✅ You have a new idea (add it with conditions)
- ✅ Something changes (church interest, contract landed, zone shift)
- ✅ Weekly review (update urgency based on current reality)

**Stay focused NOW, but know when to pivot if conditions warrant it.**
