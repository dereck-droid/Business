## 💡 DECISION-MAKING CONTEXT

**Your Personality (ENFP + Wonder/Discernment):**
- ✅ **Strengths:** Visionary, relationship builder, pattern recognition
- ⚠️ **Watch Out For:** Too many ideas, shiny object syndrome, struggle to complete
- 🎯 **Stay In Genius:** Spend 70%+ time on Wonder (exploring opportunities) + Discernment (evaluating fit)
- 🚫 **Avoid Tenacity Traps:** Use systems/AI for execution, not your time

**Current Zone:** 🔴 RED (Revenue Urgency = 50% of priority weight)

**What This Means:**
- Focus on CLOSING deals, not building new things
- Exception: Lead Supercharger research (2-3 hours) because it's strategic
- Prayer Board, Elimination Diet, Ad Checker = wait until Green Zone

---

## 🎯 FOCUS AGENT QUESTIONS (Daily Check-In)

**When this is automated, you'll answer these each morning:**

1. What's total cash across all accounts today?
2. Any bills paid yesterday or revenue received?
3. Any prospect updates? (Retarget IQ, Ben, Kin, L2T, 365, DC)
4. Any meetings scheduled or completed?
5. What feels most urgent to your Discernment today?

**Agent will then:**
- Update financial snapshot and runway
- Recalculate priority scores
- Output your top 3 actions for the day
- Commit changes to this file

## 📝 NOTES & INSIGHTS

**Key Learnings:**
- Retarget IQ has 10-15 appointments/day (massive lead flow)
- If they refer even 2-3 clients/month at $3-5K = $6-15K/month pipeline
- Partnership potential could be bigger than just Lead Supercharger
- Ben's senior team meeting next week = significant opportunity
- Your best close rate is with warm leads (Retarget IQ, Ben, Kin vs. cold pool builders)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Don't chase shiny objects (Wonder activation)
- Trust your Discernment on deal quality
- Use systems to overcome Tenacity struggles
- Close quick wins before building long-term projects
