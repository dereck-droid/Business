**Partnership Type:** AI Solutions Channel Partner for Enterprise Clients ($100M+ revenue)
**Status:** Active - Action items defined from January 30 impromptu call
**Updated:** January 30, 2026

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

**THIS IS NOT A SINGLE PROJECT - THIS IS A CHANNEL PARTNERSHIP**

**What Just Happened:**
- Guillermo called impromptu January 30 to discuss 2026 partnership strategy
- They just signed cybersecurity partnership (same model they want with you for AI)
- This is their playbook: expand service footprint through partnerships, not hiring

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (This Weekend)

### [ ] PRIORITY #1: Create AI Use Case Document for Guillermo

**Deadline:** By end of weekend (Sunday, February 2)
**Time Required:** 4-6 hours
**Importance:** CRITICAL - This is what enables him to start client conversations

**Why This Matters:**
- Guillermo said: "I'll start asking questions to some of my clients just to say, is this something that would be of interest to you" - timeline is "next week or so"
- He needs examples "in his back pocket" for client conversations
- The faster you get this to him, the faster he can pitch and the faster projects materialize
- This is low-effort, high-impact work that could unlock 6-figure opportunities

#### What to Create: 5-7 AI Use Case Examples

**Format:** Professional 2-3 page document (PDF)

**Structure for EACH Use Case:**

```
USE CASE NAME
[Clear, compelling name like "CRM Lead Generation via AI Web Crawling"]

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
[2-3 sentences on business pain point]
Example: "Sales teams spend 10-15 hours per week manually researching prospects, visiting LinkedIn profiles, company websites, and industry databases. This low-value work takes them away from actual selling, and leads often go stale while waiting for research."

HOW IT WORKS
[2-3 sentences on the solution approach - high level, not too technical]
Example: "AI-powered web crawler monitors LinkedIn, company websites, and industry databases based on your ideal customer profile. Each morning, sales team receives 10-15 qualified leads with detailed profiles, recent company news, and suggested talking points."

BUSINESS IMPACT
[Quantified outcomes - time saved, revenue generated, costs reduced]
Example:
- Saves 10-15 hours per sales rep per week
- Increases pipeline by 20-30% (more leads identified)
- Reduces time-to-contact from days to hours
- Typical ROI: 500-800% in Year 1

TECHNOLOGY
[High-level technical approach - what systems, what AI capabilities]
Example: "AI web scraping + Natural language processing + CRM integration (Dynamics 365, Salesforce, etc.) + Automated enrichment and scoring"

FEASIBILITY
[One word + brief explanation]
Options: "PROVEN" / "CUTTING EDGE" / "EXPERIMENTAL"
Example: "PROVEN - Similar systems deployed for B2B SaaS and manufacturing clients with 85%+ lead quality rates"

TYPICAL INVESTMENT
[Pricing ranges for pilot and full implementation]
Example:
- Pilot: $18-25K (3-4 weeks, 1 lead source, prove concept)
- Full Implementation: $60-100K (8-12 weeks, multiple sources, full CRM integration)
- Ongoing: $2-5K/month (maintenance, refinement, new sources)

BEST FOR
[Industries/company types that benefit most]
Example: "B2B companies with $50M+ revenue, complex sales cycles, and specific ICP criteria. Especially strong for: Manufacturing, Life Sciences, Enterprise SaaS, Professional Services."

## ONGOING ACTION ITEMS (Next 2-4 Weeks)

### [ ] Prepare Response Framework for Client "Painted Pictures"

**When Guillermo sends client needs, respond within 24-48 hours with:**

**Template:**

```
Subject: Re: [Client Name] AI Opportunity - Feasibility & Approach

Guillermo,

This is absolutely feasible. Here's how I'd approach it:

SOLUTION APPROACH:
[2-3 paragraphs on technical approach - what systems, what AI capabilities, how it integrates]

PILOT PHASE ($XX,XXX | 3-4 weeks):
- Deliverable 1 [specific and measurable]
- Deliverable 2 [specific and measurable]
- Deliverable 3 [specific and measurable]
- Success criteria: [How we measure if it worked]

[Purpose: Show value quickly, validate approach, build client confidence]

FULL IMPLEMENTATION ($XX,XXX | 8-12 weeks):
- Complete solution scope [what pilot doesn't include]
- Integration with all relevant systems
- Production deployment and scaling
- Training and documentation
- Ongoing support plan

QUESTIONS I'D NEED TO ASK THE CLIENT:
1. [Technical question about their systems/data]
2. [Business question about workflows/processes]
3. [Success criteria question about outcomes they care about]
4. [Timeline/resource question]

RISK FACTORS TO DISCUSS:
[Any concerns or unknowns that could impact success]

Let me know if you want to hop on a call to discuss before presenting to the client. Happy to join the client conversation if that's helpful.

### [ ] Stay Responsive to Guillermo

**Timeline:** He said "next week or so" for client conversations

**What This Means:**
- Week of February 3-7: He'll likely pitch AI to clients
- Week of February 10-14: Expect client "painted pictures"
- Week of February 17-21: Potentially first pilot starts

**Your Responsiveness:**
- Check email 2-3x daily during business hours
- Respond to his inquiries within 24 hours (48 hours max)
- Be available for quick calls if needed
- Show you're a reliable, responsive partner

### [ ] Optional: Research ERP/CRM Integration

**If you have extra time (not required immediately):**

**Microsoft Dynamics 365:**
- What is it? (ERP/CRM platform his clients use)
- How do you integrate with it? (APIs, Power Automate, custom apps)
- What's possible? (Data extraction, workflow automation, custom interfaces)

**Azure ML:**
- Microsoft's machine learning platform
- Likely what you'd use for facility planning use case
- High-level understanding of capabilities

**This Helps When:**
- Clients ask technical questions
- You're scoping integration work
- You need to estimate effort

**But Don't Stress:** You can learn this when actual projects materialize. For now, focus on use case document and responsiveness.

## PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE DISCUSSION (Later)

**Don't Do This Now - Wait Until After First Successful Pilot**

**Topics to Clarify Eventually:**
- Revenue split model (50/50? 60/40? Referral fee?)
- Who handles contracts? (365 Digital or joint?)
- Who owns IP developed? (Shared? Client? You?)
- How are you represented to clients? (Subcontractor? Partner? Their AI team?)
- Payment terms (Net 30? 50% upfront? Through 365 or direct?)
- Exclusivity? (Can you work with other ERP consultancies?)

**When to Discuss:** After delivering one successful pilot and proving the partnership works

**Why Wait:**
- Negotiate from strength (proven delivery)
- Understand working relationship first
- See what model actually makes sense
- Build trust before discussing money splits

---

---

## DECISION CRITERIA

### Green Lights (Why This Should Work)

✅ **Proven Model** - They just did this with cybersecurity
✅ **Motivated Partner** - Guillermo actively wants this for 2026
✅ **Access to Clients** - Enterprise clients you'd never reach solo
✅ **Currency of Trust** - They rescue projects = clients trust them
✅ **Your Skills Fit** - They need what you do (AI automation, workflow design)
✅ **No Competing Expertise** - They don't have AI in-house (not threatening)
✅ **Budget Reality** - Enterprise clients used to consulting fees
✅ **Multiple Opportunities** - Not one client, but their entire portfolio
✅ **Timeline Works** - "Next week or so" = no pressure, thoughtful approach
✅ **Chemistry** - Guillermo is friendly, collaborative, appreciates your work

### Yellow Lights (Proceed with Awareness)

🟡 **Revenue split undefined** - Need to clarify eventually (but after first pilot)
🟡 **Client relationship ownership** - Who "owns" the client? (Discuss after success)
🟡 **Scope creep risk** - Enterprise projects can balloon (manage with clear scoping)
🟡 **Your capacity** - Can you deliver multiple projects simultaneously? (Scale thoughtfully)
🟡 **Learning curve** - ERP/manufacturing domain is complex (but paid to learn)
🟡 **Partnership legal** - Need agreement at some point (after proving it works)

**None of these are blockers - just need to address over time**

### Red Flags to Watch For (None Evident Yet)

**Would be concerned if:**
- 🔴 They expect free work
- 🔴 They want to own all IP you create
- 🔴 Revenue split is unfair (<50% to you for technical delivery)
- 🔴 They oversell your capabilities to clients
- 🔴 Clients have unrealistic timelines
- 🔴 No willingness to do paid pilots
- 🔴 They micromanage your delivery

**Haven't seen any of these - all signals are positive**

## KEY REMINDERS

### Guillermo's Sales Philosophy (Critical to Understand)

**"Dream Together" Approach:**
> "Part of our strategy when we do that is we want to garner conversation. And we want them to dream about what the product can be like beyond what I'm going to build for them. And so we typically go in that way... you'll hear me say, all right, let's dream together. What do you want to do?"

**The Process:**
1. Identify problems clients didn't know they had
2. Build paid pilot to show working model ("see themselves sitting in that car")
3. Deliver in phases/releases (creates long-term engagement)
4. Use rescue projects as sales opportunity (currency of trust)

**Example:**
- Client lost $6.5M on failed deployment
- 365 Digital rescued it (going live April)
- CFO: "Thank you for saving my job"
- Guillermo: "What else can we do for you?" → Introduce AI
- Perfect positioning for upsell

**This Is Genius - And You're Now Part of It**

### What Impressed Guillermo About You

**Your Projects:**
- GFCU compliance: "That's awesome. That's the kind of stuff we're looking at."
- Music school CRM: "No, that's awesome."

**Your Positioning:**
- You use your brain (not just ChatGPT outputs)
- You provide sensible solutions (not just cool tech)
- You're honest about what's needed vs. fantasy
- He noticed and appreciated this

**Keep This Approach:**
- Be the thoughtful expert who delivers results
- Don't overpromise or oversell
- Focus on business outcomes, not cool tech
- Build trust through honesty and quality

### Why This Could Become Your Primary Revenue Channel

**The Math:**
- 1 pilot per month @ $20K = $240K/year
- 50% convert to implementations @ $75K avg = $450K additional
- Ongoing support @ $5K/month x 5 clients = $300K/year
- **Total potential: $990K annual revenue**

**And you're not doing sales - Guillermo is.**

**Your job:**
- Provide use cases (DONE after this weekend)
- Respond to client needs (validate, price, deliver)
- Deliver exceptional pilots (build reputation)
- Scale repeatable solutions (efficiency)

**This solves the hardest part of business: client acquisition.**

---

## PRIORITY LEVEL

**TIER 1 - PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT**

**Why This Is Your Top Strategic Priority:**
1. Highest annual revenue potential (6-7 figures possible)
2. Solves client acquisition problem permanently
3. Aligns with your skills perfectly
4. Guillermo actively pursuing this (not passive)
5. Action items are clear and immediate
6. Low risk (starts with use cases, then paid pilots)
7. Could become primary revenue channel for 2026

**Time Investment:**
- **This Weekend:** 4-6 hours (use case document)
- **Ongoing:** Responsive to client opportunities
- **When Projects Come:** Delivery time (but you're PAID for this)

**Cash Flow Impact:**
- Not immediate (Ben/Fraser are faster cash)
- But 30-60 days to first pilot project is realistic
- Then recurring from multiple clients
- Potential to replace all other revenue sources

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**This is potentially the most significant business development opportunity you've had.**

**What Makes It Different:**
- Not chasing clients - clients come to you (through Guillermo)
- Not competing on price - trusted advisor model
- Not one-off projects - ongoing partnership
- Not unproven - they just did this with cybersecurity successfully

**Your Weekend Task:**
Create that AI Use Case document. 4-6 hours of focused work could unlock the entire partnership.

**After That:**
Be responsive, deliver quality, and watch this grow into your primary revenue channel.

**Guillermo's closing words:**
> "I'd love to see what we might be able to dream up for some of these guys."

He's inviting you to co-create AI solutions for his enterprise clients. Partnership language, not vendor language.

**This is the real deal. Prioritize it accordingly.**
