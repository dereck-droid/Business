# Sales Meeting Communication Tactics
**Purpose:** Tactical guide for active listening and effective closing
**Created:** January 28, 2026
**Context:** Self-identified pattern of talking over prospects during discovery

---

## 🎯 The Core Problem

**Pattern Identified:** Trying to earn trust through displayed expertise
**Result:** Talking over prospects, filling silences, not truly listening
**Solution:** Listen 70%, Talk 30%

---

## 💡 The Mindset Shift

### ❌ OLD Mindset:
> "I need to prove I'm an expert so they trust me"

**Results in:**
- Talking over them
- Filling every silence with explanations
- Giving examples when they're trying to respond
- Jumping to solutions before fully hearing the problem

### ✅ NEW Mindset:
> "They already trust me (or they wouldn't be on this call). I just need to understand what they need and make it easy to say yes."

**Results in:**
- Actually listening to understand, not just waiting for your turn to speak
- Letting silences breathe
- Asking follow-up questions about THEIR points
- Letting them talk themselves into the decision

---

## 📋 The 70/30 Rule

**THEY should talk: 70% of the time**
- What's changed since last conversation
- What their team discussed
- What they're excited about
- What their concerns are
- What success looks like for them

**YOU should talk: 30% of the time**
- Acknowledging previous conversations
- Presenting options clearly and concisely
- Answering their questions ONLY (don't volunteer extra info)
- Closing: "Does this make sense? What's your gut?"

## 🗣️ Exact Opening Script (Re-Engagement)

**For prospects you've talked to before:**

```
"[Name], great to reconnect! I remember back in [Month] we talked about
[specific thing they wanted]. You said [their challenge] was an issue then.

Sounds like things have [positive change they mentioned]. Congrats!

You asked [their question from recent email/message]. I've [what's improved
on your end since last conversation].

Before I walk through that, what's changed on your end since we last talked?
[Specific question about their business]?"
```

**Then SHUT UP and LISTEN for 5-10 minutes.**

---

## 🎯 Discovery Questions Framework

### Ask, Then ACTUALLY WAIT:

**Question 1: Current State**
> "What's changed since we last talked?"

- **[WAIT FOR FULL ANSWER]**
- **[COUNT TO 3 BEFORE RESPONDING]**
- **[TAKE NOTES - FORCES YOU TO LISTEN]**

**Question 2: Recent Decisions**
> "What [specific thing they mentioned - AI tools, solutions, etc.] did you/your team explore?"

- **[WAIT FOR FULL ANSWER]**
- **[IF THEY PAUSE, DON'T FILL IT - LET THEM KEEP GOING]**
- **[THEY OFTEN ADD THE MOST VALUABLE INFO AFTER A PAUSE]**

**Question 3: Emotional Drivers**
> "What excited you most about those discussions?"

- **[WAIT FOR FULL ANSWER]**
- **[RESIST THE URGE TO SAY "YEAH, EXACTLY, AND..."]**
- **[JUST LISTEN]**

**Question 4: Concerns**
> "What concerns came up?"

- **[WAIT FOR FULL ANSWER]**
- **[DON'T IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS THE CONCERN]**
- **[LET THEM FULLY ARTICULATE IT FIRST]**

**Question 5: Current vs. Past**
> "How's [specific aspect of business] doing compared to [last time you talked]?"

- **[WAIT FOR FULL ANSWER]**
- **[LET SILENCES BREATHE]**

---

## 💬 Presentation Script (After Discovery)

**Framing:**
```
"Based on what you just said about [repeat their words back], let me show you
[number] options that address [their specific concerns].

All of them start with [core solution]. The difference is [what varies between options]."
```

**Show options clearly:**
```
"Option 1 is [simple description] at [price]. This is [what it solves].

Option 2 is [simple description] at [price]. This adds [what's different].

Option 3 is [simple description] at [price]. This is for [specific use case].

Which one feels right to you?"
```

**Then SHUT UP. Don't fill the silence. Let them process and respond.**

## 🎤 During Their Response - Critical Rules

### ❌ NEVER DO THIS:
- Think about what you'll say next while they're talking
- Interrupt with "Yeah, exactly, and..."
- Finish their sentences
- Jump in with examples while they're thinking
- Clarify your question if they pause
- Add "or like..." statements

### ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS:
- **Write down what they say** (forces actual listening)
- **Count to 3 before responding** to anything they say
- **Let pauses breathe** - if they pause, count to 10 before speaking
- **Ask follow-up questions** about THEIR points, not yours
- **Use their words back to them**: "So what I'm hearing is..."
- **Physically cover your mouth** if you catch yourself about to interrupt

---

## 🔒 Closing Script

**After presenting options:**

```
"What questions do you have?"
```
**[WAIT FOR THEIR QUESTIONS]**
**[ANSWER ONLY WHAT THEY ASK]**
**[DON'T VOLUNTEER ADDITIONAL INFO]**

```
"Does this make sense for you guys?"
```
**[WAIT FOR RESPONSE - THIS IS CRITICAL]**

```
"What's your gut telling you?"
```
**[WAIT - THIS IS THE CLOSE]**
**[THE NEXT PERSON WHO SPEAKS AFTER THIS LOSES]**

---

## 🤐 The Power of Silence

### In Sales, the Person Who Speaks After Silence Loses

**After you ask "Does this make sense?"** → **SILENCE**
**After you present pricing** → **SILENCE**
**After you ask "What's your gut?"** → **SILENCE**

**Silence is where deals get closed.**

**If the silence feels uncomfortable:**
- Count to 10 in your head
- Write notes on what they just said
- Let THEM break the silence
- They will either close themselves OR tell you the real objection

**DO NOT:**
- Fill silence with more explanation
- Re-clarify your pricing
- Add "or we could also..."
- Give them an out

## 📝 Tactical Pre-Call Prep

### Write This at Top of Your Notes Before Every Call:
```
LISTEN MORE THAN YOU TALK
70% THEM, 30% ME
```

### Have Ready (But Don't Screen Share Unless Asked):
- Proposal document
- 5-7 discovery questions (not a presentation)
- Their previous context (what you discussed before)

### DON'T Have Ready:
- Slides or extensive materials
- Multiple examples to share
- Long explanations prepared

## 🎯 Specific Anti-Patterns to Watch For

### Pattern 1: "Yeah, exactly, and..."
**What it sounds like:** They say something, you immediately agree and add to it
**Why it's bad:** You're not really listening, you're just waiting for your turn
**Fix:** Count to 3 before responding. Ask "Tell me more about that" instead.

### Pattern 2: Filling Silences
**What it sounds like:** They pause to think, you immediately give more explanation
**Why it's bad:** They need space to process. Silence is productive.
**Fix:** Count to 10. Let them break the silence.

### Pattern 3: Over-Explaining
**What it sounds like:** Giving 3 examples when they only asked for 1
**Why it's bad:** You're overwhelming them and showing insecurity
**Fix:** Answer what they asked. Stop. Wait for next question.

### Pattern 4: Finishing Their Sentences
**What it sounds like:** They start to say something, you complete it "showing you understand"
**Why it's bad:** You don't know what they were about to say
**Fix:** Physically cover your mouth if needed. Let them finish.

### Pattern 5: Jumping to Solutions
**What it sounds like:** They describe a problem, you immediately present your solution
**Why it's bad:** You haven't fully understood the problem yet
**Fix:** Ask 2-3 follow-up questions before presenting any solution

## 💪 Practice This Before Every Call

**5 Minutes Before Call Starts:**

1. Read your notes: "LISTEN MORE THAN YOU TALK"
2. Set intention: "I will count to 3 before responding"
3. Prepare questions, not presentations
4. Remember: They already trust you (or they wouldn't be on this call)
5. Goal: Understand them, make it easy to say yes

**During Call:**

1. Take actual notes (forces listening)
2. Count to 3 before responding
3. Let silences breathe
4. Ask follow-ups about THEIR points
5. Answer only what they ask

**After Call:**

1. Did they talk more than you? (70/30 check)
2. Did you interrupt? (If yes, practice more next time)
3. Did you let silences breathe? (If no, practice counting to 10)
4. Did they feel heard? (They'll tell you by how they respond)

## 🎬 Remember

**Your job is NOT to:**
- Prove you're an expert
- Show all your knowledge
- Convince them of anything
- Fill every silence
- Control the conversation

**Your job IS to:**
- Understand what they need
- Present clear options
- Make it easy to say yes
- Let them talk themselves into the decision
- Close when they're ready

**The best salespeople talk the least.**

---

## 🚀 When This Works

**You'll know this is working when:**
- They say "yes" before you finish presenting
- They ask for the contract without you asking
- They say "this is exactly what we need"
- They tell you things they didn't plan to share
- The decision feels easy and obvious

**That's the power of listening more than you talk.**
