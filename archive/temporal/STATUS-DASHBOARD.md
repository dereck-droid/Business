## 🚨 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS (January 30, 2026)

### 🎉 365 Digital: NOW A CHANNEL PARTNERSHIP (Game-Changer!)

**What Changed:** Guillermo called impromptu Thursday to discuss 2026 partnership strategy

**This is NO LONGER a single project - this is a CHANNEL PARTNERSHIP**

**Partnership Model:**
- 365 Digital brings enterprise clients ($100M+ revenue companies)
- They just signed cybersecurity partnership (same model they want with you for AI)
- Guillermo sells AI capabilities to his clients → You deliver solutions
- Revenue shared (structure TBD, discuss after first successful pilot)

**Your Action This Weekend:**
- ✅ **CRITICAL:** Create AI use case document (5-7 use cases) for Guillermo
- Send by Sunday evening or Monday morning
- He'll start pitching to clients "next week or so"

**Annual Value Potential:**
- Conservative: $95-300K Year 1
- Moderate: $250-630K Year 1
- Optimistic: $560K-1.53M Year 1+

**Why This Is Huge:** Solves client acquisition problem - no more cold outreach!

### 🎉 RAMP Manufacturing: DIRECT CALL WITH FOUNDERS (Monday Meeting!)

**What Changed:** Had direct phone conversation with Saj Patel & Dave Riggs (January 30)

**Problem Clearly Defined:**
- Manufacturing ramp-up documentation is labor-intensive and slows time-to-market
- They want AI to "substantially reduce" engineering labor for creating SOPs, work instructions, quality procedures
- 80-90% time reduction is achievable with AI (proven in market)

**Meeting Scheduled:** Monday, February 3, 2026 at 11:00 AM

**Your Action This Weekend:**
- ✅ Review manufacturing documentation types (30 min)
- ✅ Familiarize with manufacturing systems (30 min)
- ✅ Prepare discovery questions (30 min)
- ✅ Have paid discovery proposal ready ($3,500-5,000)

**Value Potential:**
- Conservative: $15-30K initial + $3-5K/month
- Moderate: $25-40K implementation
- Optimistic: $50-100K partnership + equity/revenue share

**See:**
- [ACTION-ITEMS-RAMP-MANUFACTURING.md](./ACTION-ITEMS-RAMP-MANUFACTURING.md)

### Ben/EquityPro: Had Thursday Meeting, Thinking Over Weekend

**Meeting Held:** Thursday, January 30, 2026 at 9:30 AM
**Outcome:** Sent comprehensive proposal, he's taking weekend to think
**Follow-Up:** Monday, February 3, 2026 at 2:00 PM

**Status:** Waiting for his decision - could close, could need negotiation
