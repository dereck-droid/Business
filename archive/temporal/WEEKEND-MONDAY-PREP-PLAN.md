---

## CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### If Retarget IQ Takes Longer Than Expected

**Adjust:**
- Extend Retarget IQ time, reduce 365 Digital time
- 365 Digital doc can be 3-4 use cases instead of 7 (start with his specific asks)
- Send what you have Sunday evening, add more later
- RAMP prep can be 1 hour instead of 2-3

**Priority:**
- Deliver on existing commitment (Retarget IQ)
- Then strategic work (365 Digital)
- Then Monday prep (RAMP, Ben)

### If You're Feeling Overwhelmed

**Adjust:**
- Take Saturday evening off completely (no RAMP prep)
- Move RAMP prep to Sunday morning
- Reduce 365 Digital to 3 use cases (can add more later)
- Ask for help (delegate if possible)

**Remember:**
- You have a psychiatrist appointment Monday - that's why
- This is marathon, not sprint
- It's okay to say no or ask for extensions

### If Monday Meetings Go Long or Badly

**If RAMP or Ben meetings are draining:**
- It's okay to reschedule psychiatrist if you need to
- But don't cancel - this is important
- Take extra time between meetings to recover

**If Ben passes:**
- That's okay - you have 365 Digital and RAMP
- Process the disappointment
- Don't let it affect psychiatrist session or self-care

**If RAMP is a pass:**
- That's okay - you have 365 Digital and Ben
- Focus on what's working
- Learn from the experience

## REMINDERS

### You're Building Something Sustainable

This isn't about heroics. This is about building a business that works for you long-term.

**Key Principles:**
- Quality over quantity
- Progress over perfection
- Health over hustle
- Sustainable over sprint

### You Have Multiple Good Opportunities

- **365 Digital:** Channel partnership, $95K-1.5M potential
- **RAMP:** $25-40K realistic, manufacturing entry
- **Ben:** $5-20K, real estate client
- **Retarget IQ:** Active project, keep them happy

**You're not desperate. You're in demand.**

Approach Monday from abundance, not scarcity.

### Self-Care Is Not Optional

You have a psychiatrist appointment Monday because you've recognized you need support. That's mature and smart.

**Don't sabotage your own self-care by:**
- Working until exhaustion
- Skipping sleep
- Skipping meals
- Skipping the appointment

**The business needs you healthy more than it needs you heroic.**
