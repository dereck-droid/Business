Hey team! 👋

I've completed version 1 of our Retarget IQ knowledge base!

📊 What we analyzed:
• 299 email support threads
• 30 call transcripts (15+ hours of recordings)
• Extracted and refined down to 52 high-quality FAQs

The knowledge base is organized into 8 categories:
✓ Product Features & Capabilities
✓ Data & Intent Signals
✓ Pricing & Plans
✓ White Label & Agency
✓ Integrations & API
✓ Pixel & Tracking
✓ Audience Building & Targeting
✓ Technical Support

📄 I've created a Google Doc-ready markdown file for easy review.

🔍 Need your help to:
1. Review all 52 Q&As for accuracy
2. Verify pricing information is current
3. Confirm technical details are correct
4. Identify any gaps - what important questions are we missing?

This will power our AI chat support interface, so accuracy is critical. Please add comments directly in the doc where you see issues or have questions.

Let me know when you're ready and I'll send over the link!
