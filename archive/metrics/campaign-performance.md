## Campaign Optimization Notes

**What to Test if No Responses After Week 1:**
1. Subject line variations (more curiosity-driven?)
2. Shorter email body (attention span)
3. Different pain point (revenue vs. time savings?)
4. Video introduction (personal touch)
5. Case study/proof (roofing company success story)

**What NOT to Change:**
- Target market (pool builders fit criteria well)
- Infrastructure (49 inboxes, 1,200/day is solid)
- Too early to abandon campaign

## Notes & Learnings

**Key Insights:**
- Warm leads convert far better than cold (100% vs. 0% meeting rate)
- Cold campaigns require patience (7-14 days for responses)
- Not all industries respond to cold outreach (civil engineering learned)
- Home services (roofing) have proven responsive historically

**Strategic Decisions:**
- Don't abandon pool campaign too early
- Continue prioritizing warm lead follow-up
- Use cold campaigns as background activity, not primary focus
- Build referral/partnership channels (Retarget IQ model)

**Future Considerations:**
- Build case studies from successful projects (roofing, music school)
- Create video testimonials where possible
- Develop industry-specific messaging
- Test partnership channels vs. pure cold outreach
