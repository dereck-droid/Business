## 🔥 BREAKTHROUGH: JANUARY 30 IMPROMPTU CALL

**[Full Meeting Transcript & Recording (34 mins)](../communications/transcripts/2026-01-30-365-digital-impromptu-call.md)**
**[Watch Recording](https://fathom.video/share/w98vxzFB2bYcadxGXCQW9x9UcitzK5yc)**

### What Just Happened

Guillermo called impromptu (unscheduled) to discuss **strategic partnership for 2026** - not just the ERP plugin project.

**THIS IS NO LONGER A SINGLE PROJECT OPPORTUNITY.**
**THIS IS A CHANNEL PARTNERSHIP.**

### The Partnership Model Explained

**What 365 Digital Brings:**
- Enterprise clients ($100M+ revenue companies)
- Existing trust relationships (they do project rescue work)
- "Currency of trust" after rescuing failed $6.5M+ deployments
- Microsoft ERP/CRM implementation expertise
- Project management, OCM, and now cybersecurity
- Sales and upsell opportunities

**What You Bring:**
- AI automation expertise and implementation
- Custom solutions beyond what Microsoft Copilot can deliver
- Workflow automation and system integration
- Ability to "dream with clients" about what's possible
- Execution on paid pilots → full implementations

**How It Works:**
1. 365 Digital identifies AI opportunities with their enterprise clients
2. Guillermo pitches AI capabilities using use cases you provide
3. Clients get excited and "paint a picture" of what they need
4. Guillermo sends you the painted picture
5. You validate feasibility, frame solution, and provide pricing
6. 365 Digital + You deliver together (paid pilot → implementation)
7. Revenue shared (structure TBD, but similar to their cybersecurity partnership)

**Guillermo's Words:**
> "I'd rather work through a channel of partnership because it's better for you and I, you know, at the end of the day."

> "Part of what our clients are looking at is saying, what can companies do right now to take advantage... what can we do with AI?"

> "That's why this partnership is important to us because the partnership is just good for small businesses all around just to work with each other. But it also lets me add to a footprint that I don't have any expertise for in-house and I really don't have a desire to hire anyone to do."

### Why This Is HUGE

**1. Access to Enterprise Clients You'd Never Reach Solo**
- $100M+ revenue companies
- Life sciences, pharma, biotech, manufacturing
- Already have trust with 365 Digital
- Already spending $5-15M on ERP implementations
- AI budget is marginal compared to what they're already investing

**2. Guillermo Sells, You Deliver**
- He has relationships and sales expertise
- You focus on what you're great at: solution design and implementation
- He's motivated (expanding his service footprint)
- You're motivated (revenue + enterprise portfolio)

**3. Proven Model (They Just Did This with Cybersecurity)**
- Guillermo: "We just signed an agreement with a cybersecurity company. We're going to start partnering with."
- This is their PLAYBOOK for 2026
- AI is the next vertical they want to add
- You're being positioned like the cybersecurity partner

**4. Multiple Revenue Streams**
- Paid pilots ($10-30K each)
- Full implementations ($50-200K+ depending on complexity)
- Ongoing support/enhancements
- Multiple clients = recurring engagement model

**5. "Currency of Trust" Sales Model**
- They rescue failed projects → client is grateful
- CFO: "Thank you for saving my job"
- Guillermo: "What can we do for you long-term?"
- Client is receptive → Perfect time to introduce AI/cyber/other services
- **This is genius positioning**

### Specific AI Use Cases They Want

**1. Facility Planning with Large SKU Counts (2-3 Million SKUs)**
- Microsoft Copilot "would malfunction" - doesn't have capacity/bandwidth
- Need machine learning on top of AI
- Build scalable model that supplements Microsoft ERP
- **Their words:** "If we were to build, bring in something different and use machine learning on top of that, well, then we have a working scalable model."

**2. CRM Lead Generation (Web Crawling)**
- Crawl Internet, LinkedIn, etc. to identify potential clients
- AI identifies companies using competitor products
- Delivers 10-15 qualified leads daily to sales team
- "Virtual salesman" that works overnight
- **Guillermo's pitch to clients:** "How great would it be when you show up to work every morning, you've got 10 or 15 leads that have been scraped for you?"

**3. Enhanced CRM/ERP User Experience**
- Supplement Microsoft platforms (not replace)
- Beyond what Power Apps can do
- Custom AI that integrates with their existing systems
- Focus on enhancing experience, not replacing humans

**4. Sales Enablement & Automation**
- "Virtual salesman" concept
- Help sales teams be more effective
- Proactive lead identification
- Automated research on prospects
- **Context:** "Businesses right now are suffering. It's a horrible economy. So what do they need? They need someone that's a virtual salesman for them."

### Their Sales Approach (You Need to Understand This)

**Guillermo's Philosophy:**
> "Part of our strategy when we do that is we want to garner conversation. And we want them to dream about what the product can be like beyond what I'm going to build for them. And so we typically go in that way. And it's just like sometimes, you know, if we get a chance to go into an engagement together, you'll hear me say, all right, let's dream together. What do you want to do?"

**The Process:**
1. **Identify problem clients didn't know they had**
   - "Part of what gets us in front of a client and perks their ears up is when we start identifying some potential solutions around problems they didn't know they necessarily had."

2. **Build paid pilot to show working model**
   - Not full product, just enough to "see themselves sitting in that car"
   - Vision of what's possible

3. **Deliver in phases/releases**
   - Can't give everything at once
   - Build MVP, then enhance over time
   - Creates long-term engagement ("long stay")

4. **Use rescue projects as sales opportunity**
   - Fix their failed deployment
   - Build currency of trust
   - CFO is grateful (job was saved)
   - "What else can we do for you?" → Introduce AI, cybersecurity, etc.

**Example Client:**
- Lost $6.5M on deployment
- 365 Digital came in 7 months ago
- Going live in April (rescue successful)
- CFO will say "thank you for saving my job"
- Perfect moment to introduce AI capabilities

**Guillermo:**
> "Now I get to have a conversation with them saying, what can you and I do long term? You know, my team delivers results. What can we do for you? And this is where we would, you know, introduce something like either cyber where we can bring in and do an analysis of, you know, what all their cybersecurity compliance is. Can we help you on the AI side of your sales? I know that's going to perk his ears up."

### Market Context They Shared

**Amazon Situation:**
- Laid off 28,000 people recently
- Guillermo's clients see this as "wounded giant"
- **Not AI replacing jobs** (Guillermo's view: "AI hasn't laid off 28,000 people. There's something else going on.")
- Competitors want to take advantage while Amazon is restructuring
- **Opportunity:** "How can we take advantage of that so we can start circumventing... well, let's see what we can do with AI."

**Economic Climate:**
- "It's a horrible economy"
- Businesses are suffering
- Looking for edge over competitors
- AI seen as competitive advantage
- "How do we get an edge over everybody else? That's the big conversation right now. Everyone is cutthroat."

**Why This Matters:**
- Clients are motivated to invest in AI
- Competitive pressure = budget allocated
- Economic hardship = need efficiency/automation
- Perfect storm for AI adoption

## 💰 OPPORTUNITY VALUE ASSESSMENT

### This Is NOT a $20-40K Discovery Project

**This is a PARTNERSHIP with multiple revenue streams:**

**Conservative Annual Value (Year 1):**
- 3-4 paid pilots @ $15-25K each = $45-100K
- 1-2 full implementations @ $50-100K each = $50-200K
- **Total: $95-300K in Year 1**

**Moderate Annual Value (Year 1):**
- 5-6 paid pilots @ $20-30K each = $100-180K
- 2-3 full implementations @ $75-150K each = $150-450K
- **Total: $250-630K in Year 1**

**Optimistic Annual Value (Year 1+):**
- 8-10 paid pilots @ $25-35K each = $200-350K
- 3-5 full implementations @ $100-200K each = $300-1M
- Ongoing support contracts @ $5-15K/month = $60-180K/year
- **Total: $560K-1.53M potential**

### Revenue Split Model (TBD)

**Option A: Referral Fee**
- 365 Digital gets 15-25% of project revenue
- You keep 75-85%
- Simple, clean

**Option B: Joint Delivery**
- 365 does project management/client relationship
- You do technical delivery
- Split 50/50 or 60/40 (you get 60% as technical lead)

**Option C: Subcontractor**
- 365 sells at their markup
- You bill 365 at your rate
- They handle all client relationship
- Consistent revenue, less variability

**Most Likely:** Hybrid of B and C depending on project complexity

### Why This Could Scale Quickly

**1. They Already Have Active Clients**

**3. Multiple Clients in Pipeline**
- Current rescue project (going live April) = immediate upsell opportunity
- Life sciences clients (pharma, biotech, medical devices)
- Manufacturing clients
- Guillermo is actively expanding (hiring more people, adding services)

**4. Repeatable Solutions**
- Build once, customize for multiple clients
- CRM lead generation = applicable to most clients
- Facility planning = manufacturing clients
- Can create productized offerings

**5. Guillermo Is Motivated**
- 2026 strategic initiative
- Just did cybersecurity partnership (same model)

3. **Provide pricing ranges** (pilot vs. full implementation)
4. **Ask clarifying questions** if needed
5. **Respond within 24-48 hours** (show responsiveness)

**Response Template:**
```
Guillermo,

This is absolutely feasible. Here's how I'd approach it:

**SOLUTION APPROACH:**
[2-3 paragraphs on technical approach]

**PILOT PHASE ($XX,XXX | 3-4 weeks):**
- Deliverable 1
- Deliverable 2
- Deliverable 3
[Enough to show value and validate approach]

**FULL IMPLEMENTATION ($XX,XXX | 8-12 weeks):**
- Complete solution scope
- Integration with existing systems
- Training and documentation

**QUESTIONS I'D NEED TO ASK THE CLIENT:**
1. [Technical question]
2. [Data/system question]
3. [Success criteria question]

Let me know if you want to hop on a call to discuss approach before presenting to client.

-Dereck
```

### 3. Create Standardized Pricing Framework

**Tier 1: Simple Automation ($8-15K pilot | $25-50K implementation)**
- Single system integration
- Clear workflow
- Minimal complexity
- Example: Lead nurture automation, meeting note capture

**Tier 2: Moderate AI Solution ($15-30K pilot | $50-125K implementation)**
- Multi-system integration
- Custom AI logic
- Data processing required
- Example: Compliance analysis, document generation, CRM enhancement

**Tier 3: Complex ML Solution ($25-50K pilot | $100-250K implementation)**
- Machine learning models
- Large data sets
- Multiple integrations
- Ongoing training/refinement
- Example: Facility planning, demand forecasting, predictive analytics

### 4. Set Up Partnership Structure Discussion

**Topics to Clarify (Eventually, Not Immediately):**
- Revenue split model
- Who handles contracts? (365 or joint?)
- Who owns IP developed?
- How are you represented to clients? (Subcontractor? Partner? Their AI team?)
- Payment terms (Net 30? 50% upfront?)
- Exclusivity? (Can you work with other ERP consultancies?)

**When to discuss:** After first successful pilot, not before

## 📋 PARTNERSHIP SUCCESS FRAMEWORK

### Green Lights (Why This Should Work)

✅ **Proven Model** - They just did this with cybersecurity
✅ **Motivated Partner** - Guillermo actively wants this for 2026
✅ **Access to Clients** - Enterprise clients you'd never reach solo
✅ **Currency of Trust** - They rescue projects = clients trust them
✅ **Your Skills Fit** - They need what you do (AI automation, workflow design)
✅ **No Competing Expertise** - They don't have AI in-house (not threatening)
✅ **Budget Reality** - Enterprise clients used to consulting fees
✅ **Multiple Opportunities** - Not one client, but their entire portfolio
✅ **Timeline Works** - "Next week or so" = no pressure, thoughtful approach
✅ **Chemistry** - Guillermo is friendly, collaborative, appreciates your work

### Yellow Lights (Proceed with Awareness)

🟡 **Revenue split undefined** - Need to clarify eventually
🟡 **Client relationship ownership** - Who "owns" the client?
🟡 **Scope creep risk** - Enterprise projects can balloon
🟡 **Your capacity** - Can you deliver multiple projects simultaneously?
🟡 **Learning curve** - ERP/manufacturing domain is complex
🟡 **Partnership legal** - Need agreement at some point

**None of these are blockers - just need to address over time**

### Red Flags to Watch For (None Evident Yet)

🔴 **Would be concerned if:**
- They expect free work
- They want to own all IP you create
- Revenue split is unfair (<50% to you for technical delivery)
- They oversell your capabilities to clients
- Clients have unrealistic timelines
- No willingness to do paid pilots
- They micromanage your delivery

**Haven't seen any of these - all signals are positive**

## The AI/ERP Plugin Opportunity

**What Bill Described in December Call:**

**The Vision:**
After ERP implementations, clients want to stick around and do more. 365 sees opportunity to develop AI-powered applications that layer ON TOP of ERP systems to fill gaps.

**Example Use Case: BMW Truck Demand Forecasting**
- BMW (or similar manufacturer) finishes cars on production line
- Need to know how many trucks to schedule for pickup
- Currently: Manual planning based on estimates → often wrong → wasted costs
- AI Solution: Analyze historical data (seasonal patterns, production history, employee attendance) → predict actual output → optimize truck scheduling
- **Impact:** Reduce transportation costs, improve planning accuracy

**Technology Approach:**
- Applications that sit "on top of" ERP (Microsoft Dynamics F&O)
- Leverage Azure ML (Microsoft's machine learning platform)
- Use Python libraries: Prophet (time series forecasting), scikit-learn (ML)
- Applied machine learning, not building novel AI from scratch
- Focus: Predictive analytics, forecasting, workflow automation

**What They Need:**
Someone who can:
1. **Understand business operations** (not just code)
2. **Interview stakeholders** and translate to technical requirements
3. **Design AI-powered workflows** that solve real problems
4. **Build applications** that integrate with ERP systems
5. **Think strategically** about what's feasible vs. aspirational

**What They're NOT Looking For:**
- Pure developers who just write code
- People who need hand-holding on business context
- Manufacturing domain experts (they have that)
- Generic AI consultants selling templates

**What They ARE Looking For:**
- Strategic thinker who understands operations
- AI automation expert who can architect solutions
- Someone who asks smart questions and translates business needs to technical solutions
- Partner who can grow with them as this becomes a bigger part of their business

## Why You're A Strong Fit (Despite Doubts)

**From Your December Conversation:**

**You Said:** "I feel underqualified for the opportunity since it's so high level and probably very complex"

**BUT Claude Analyzed And Said:**

### What You Bring That They Desperately Need:

**1. Business Operations Mastery**
- 8 years running music school
- Systematic thinking that created 18-month retention vs. 3-6 month industry standard
- You understand how businesses ACTUALLY work (not just theory)

**2. Complex System Design**
- Built $85K compliance system with 100% accuracy (GFCU)
- Impressed federal credit union leadership
- Enterprise-grade thinking and delivery

**3. You Speak Human, Not Just Code**
- High Influence DISC profile
- Can interview business stakeholders
- Translate operations into automation logic
- **THIS IS THE RAREST SKILL**

**4. Wonder + Discernment Combo**
- Spot opportunities and evaluate solutions
- Exactly what's needed in discovery phases

**5. Track Record of Mastering Hard Domains**
- Music education → Marketing → AI automation
- You've proven you can learn complex domains

### What Bill Said That Shows They See The Fit:

**Bill's Response to Your Concerns:**
"We could certainly do something like that because I think when we think about framework in terms of the ERP world, it's like when you move into a new subdivision... the model home is just a framework... We still need to do a lot of your design period."

**Translation:** "We don't need you to know everything. We need you to figure it out WITH us."

**Bill Also Said:**
"Your design period is probably an eight to 16-week engagement just for design. And that means getting in there, interviewing the business, finding out how they run their process."

**Translation:** "You'll have 8-16 weeks PAID to learn their systems. That's the job."

### Bill's Own Story (Confidence Booster):

**Bill told you:** "Elaine and I never ran a business before, and we kind of figured it out as we went along."

**7 years later:** Multi-million dollar enterprise consulting firm.

**If Bill can learn enterprise project management from zero, you can learn ERP integrations.**

**Example Workflow:**
1. Extract historical data from ERP (orders, production, shipments, etc.)
2. Clean and prepare data (pandas)
3. Identify patterns (seasonal, trends)
4. Build forecasting model (Prophet or scikit-learn)
5. Test accuracy against historical data
6. Deploy model to make predictions
7. Feed predictions back to ERP or dashboard for decision-makers

### 3. Review December Conversation Context (1 hour)

**Re-read the full transcript and note:**
- What excited Bill and Elaine?
- What concerns did you raise?
- What examples did they give?
- What did they say about next steps?
- What questions did they ask you?

**Key Quotes to Remember:**

**Bill:** "Part of what we're seeing is opportunity is starting to look at AI... we could start developing applications within the ERP space that can help facilitate a lot of forecasting and things like that."

**Bill:** "We want to start developing applications that we could resell, based on what we think is just a shortcoming in ERP packages that are out there."

**Bill:** "Why don't I have Elaine send you a two-way NDA... That way we can speak a lot more freely about the clients that we have and also some of the IP that we're looking at creating."

## Your Positioning for This Meeting

### What You Say Upfront:

**"Since we last talked, I've been diving deeper into manufacturing and ERP integration opportunities. Actually meeting with another contact this week about an ERP plugin for manufacturing/shipping workflows, so the timing is perfect for learning this space more deeply."**

**"I've also been refining my approach: I'm the expert in AI automation and workflow design. I lean on domain experts (like you and your clients) for the manufacturing/ERP knowledge, and I translate that into technical solutions. That partnership approach has worked really well for me."**

### Your Confidence Statement:

**"Here's what I bring to this:**
- Deep business operations thinking (8 years running a music school systematically)
- Proven AI automation delivery (100% accuracy on federal credit union compliance system)
- Ability to interview stakeholders and design solutions (high communication skills)
- Track record of mastering complex domains quickly

**"Here's what I'd need from you:**
- Partnership on the manufacturing/ERP domain knowledge
- Clear access to stakeholders during discovery
- Realistic timeline that accounts for learning curve (which your 8-16 week discovery phases naturally provide)"

### Your Proposed Approach:

**"I'd recommend a paid discovery engagement where I:**
1. Interview the client's operations team to understand workflows
2. Analyze their ERP data and identify automation opportunities
3. Design the technical architecture for AI integration
4. Deliver a detailed implementation plan with effort estimates
5. Build a proof-of-concept to validate the approach

**"This de-risks it for everyone - the client gets valuable deliverables regardless, and we validate technical feasibility before committing to full implementation."**

**"Given your typical 8-16 week discovery phases at $20-40K, that structure would work perfectly."**
