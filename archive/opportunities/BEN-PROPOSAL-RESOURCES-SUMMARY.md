## 📦 What Was Created Today

### 1. ✅ Updated Proposal (PRIORITY - Send This First)
**File:** `ben-equitypro-ghl-crm-proposal-final.md`

**What Changed:**

- ✅ Added **Ownership & Portability section** - Clear statement: "You own 100% of this build"
- ✅ Added **What Your Team Will See Daily section** - Detailed workflow examples (Jason, Sarah, Ben's views)

**Why It Matters:**
Directly addresses Ben's email concerns:
- "$20K for software I won't own" → **Ownership section proves he owns it**
