# Ben/EquityPro Follow-Up Call Script

**Date:** January 30, 2026 (Thursday afternoon)
**Purpose:** Present SmartLead + GHL architecture and pricing
**Goal:** Get commitment to move forward

---

## OPENING

"Hey Ben, thanks again for the time this morning. As I mentioned, I wanted to follow up after doing some deeper research on the technical approach for your 8,000-10,000 cold leads. Do you have 10-15 minutes?"

---

## THE ARCHITECTURE (Why Two Platforms)

### The Problem with GHL-Only for Cold Email

"After our call, I consulted with a GHL expert who's built over 300 systems. Here's what I learned:

**Your 8,000-10,000 leads are 24-36 months cold** - that's definitively cold outreach territory.

Using GoHighLevel alone for that scale of cold email has serious risks:
- Could blacklist your domain
- Affects your business email deliverability
- Lacks sophisticated cold email features
- GHL is designed for inbound/warm leads, not cold outreach

**The expert explicitly recommended against it.**"

### The Right Approach: SmartLead + GHL

"The right way is a **two-platform architecture**:

**SmartLead = Cold Email Engine (Behind the Scenes)**
- Handles all cold outreach to your 8K-10K leads
- Built-in email warmup (protects your domain)
- GPT-4 automatically categorizes responses: Interested, Objection, Referral, Out-of-Office
- Advanced cold email features (email variations, smart domain rotation)
- Runs in the background - protects your main domain

**GoHighLevel = Your Command Center (What Your Team Uses)**
- This is the interface your team sees and uses daily
- When SmartLead gets an "interested" response, it automatically sends that lead to GHL
- GHL handles the warm nurturing from there
- Your team primarily works in GHL - SmartLead runs invisibly

**From your team's perspective:** It feels like ONE unified system, but you get the benefits of best-in-class cold email protection.

**And here's what makes this implementation different:** I'm not just dropping in a generic template. I'm going to work closely with you and your team to understand how you currently operate in your existing CRM - what works, what doesn't, what your team is used to. Then I'll **mirror those proven workflows in the new system** so adoption is smooth. Your team won't feel like they're learning something completely foreign. Plus, we'll identify opportunities to streamline and improve efficiency where it makes sense."

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (If Needed)

**Quick clarifications:**

1. "For the cold email campaigns, you mentioned you have templates. Can I work from those and adapt them for cold email best practices?"

2. "For follow-up drips, would you write those yourselves or want my guidance on structure?"

3. "How many team members will be using the system daily?"

4. "Does your senior team need to approve this, or can you make the decision?"

## CLOSING

### Direct Ask

"Based on what we discussed this morning and the two-platform architecture I'm recommending, does $19,500 with [payment option] work for you?"

### If He Says YES

"Great. I'll send over the agreement this afternoon. Once you sign and we get the first payment, I'll kick off immediately. We'll have you operational in 30 days."

### If He Needs to Think / Consult Team

"That makes sense. What specific information does your team need?"

[Provide whatever they need]

"When would be good to reconnect after you've had a chance to discuss?"

[Pin down specific date/time]

"I understand. What's your main concern?"

**If he needs more flexibility:**
- "We could phase it - start with SmartLead + basic GHL setup around $12K, then add advanced features once you see results"
- "If you don't need the 30-day rush, I can do a 60-day timeline for $16,500"
- "Another option is $16,500 upfront + $1,750/month for ongoing management if you'd prefer that structure"
