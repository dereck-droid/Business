## 💡 Pro Tips for Demo Video

**Show, Don't Tell:**
- ❌ "You can assign leads to team members"
- ✅ "Watch this - I'm assigning Maria's hot lead to Jason..." (show it happening)

**Use Real Scenarios:**
- "Let's say it's Monday morning and Jason logs in..."
- "Sarah just got a text from a motivated seller..."
- "Marcus needs to find buyers in the College Park area..."

**Emphasize Speed:**
- "This used to take 5 clicks in your Drupal CRM - now it's one."
- "Instead of switching between 3 tools, it's all right here."

**Address Ben's Concerns:**
- "Notice how InvestorBase is right here in the sidebar - your team never leaves this interface."
- "Everything you see here - you own. This exact setup transfers to your own account anytime."

**Be Conversational:**
- Not a sales pitch - you're showing a colleague your work
- "Pretty cool, right?" "Check this out..." "Here's my favorite feature..."

## 📊 Metrics to Highlight in Demo

If dashboard shows these numbers, emphasize them:
- **Pipeline Value:** $705,000 (from 5 active deals)
- **Appointments This Week:** 3 (Maria, Linda, Elizabeth)
- **Response Rate:** 42% (from AI outreach)
- **Team Performance:** Jason 3 deals, Sarah 2 deals, Marcus 2 deals
- **Buyer Engagement:** 8 active buyers, 31 total in database

**Even if numbers are mock, they paint the picture of what Ben's dashboard will show.**

## 🚨 Common Demo Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Talking too fast (you know it well, Ben doesn't)
❌ Using jargon ("webhooks," "API endpoints," "CRM entities")
❌ Showing features he doesn't need (keep it focused)
❌ Long silences while clicking around (narrate what you're doing)
❌ Apologizing ("Sorry, this is a bit messy" - shows lack of confidence)

✅ Slow, deliberate pace
✅ Plain language ("When a seller texts back, it shows here...")
✅ Only show what solves his problems
✅ Keep talking (narrate every action)
✅ Be confident (this IS impressive!)
